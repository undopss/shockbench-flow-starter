"""Event types, targets and marks (design §4.4), the unexcited Poisson components (Q50), and omega's event arrays.

Every draw is keyed by the event's genealogical key (§4.1 streams), by inversion of keyed uniforms, so the same
event has the same marks at every rung (V2) and whatever the policy does:
- type and target: stream 9, key (*event key): uniforms (type, target). Immigrants are typed over the same
  X-modulated parts as their intensity (``targets.week_parts`` at the key's week, the one rule of the cluster
  sampler's rate); children over ``targets.type_weights``. A block with no feasible type makes a no-op event, which
  is not stored in omega.
- duration: stream 2, key (*event key) (two uniforms for the persistent mixture (39) or the one-day branch);
  severity: stream 3, key (*event key); counterpart of a regional conflict: stream 21, key (*event key), not drawn for
  a partnerless one (counterpart -1, Q94 (f)); tariff rate by the imposing region's tension state at onset: stream 16,
  key (imposing region, *event key); restoration of a regional conflict's fab and OSAT hits: stream 10, key (*event
  key, 0) -> (dead time T0, tau_rho) (regime C, §2.4).
- weather and accident closures: stream 14, key (chokepoint node, week + B_burn) count by Poisson inversion, marks key
  (chokepoint node, week + B_burn, rank): (onset offset, duration, severity by its law, 1 in the §2.4 profile).
- port strikes: stream 15, key (region, week + B_burn) count, marks key (region, week + B_burn, rank): (onset offset,
  stoppage-or-slowdown, duration, severity), on the struck region (active regions only).
- dyad strait closures (`small` and `full`, M5-O13 default): no draw; a regional conflict between the two regions of a
  ``params.laws.strait_closures`` entry derives a militarised closure of its chokepoint, key (*conflict key, 2, node)
  (``strait_closures``).
Events enter omega when they have a graph operation, their window reaches into the episode (end > 0) and their onset
is before T (carried-in events included, §4.3). Weather events use block -1 and keys (7, chokepoint, week + B_burn,
rank); strikes (8, region, week + B_burn, rank).

Readings where the design leaves the rule open (reported for design rows):
- An event of onset s reads the regime of its onset week t = floor(s) + 1 (column t + B_burn); an immigrant reads the
  week of its key (block, region, t + B_burn, rank), the same week unless the onset rounds onto the week's end: the
  conflict state and the dyad chains (``targets.TypeRules.state``) that set the feasible types and name a conflict's
  counterpart, the tension state that sets a tariff's rate, and (immigrants) the chokepoints' g(X^t_c)/c_X.
- A regional conflict takes the partner of a dyad at war that contains its region as counterpart (uniform among
  such partners, stream 21), else a region drawn with weight A_{m .}; a war from a dyad takes precedence over the
  region's own chain. Both are the conflict's candidates (``targets.candidate_targets``), so a dyad war makes the
  conflict feasible in a region with no A partner, against the dyad partner (CMP-1). A war-state region with neither
  gets its conflict with counterpart -1 (Q94 (f)), drawn on no stream 21 uniform (the draws are keyed, so no other
  draw moves); the marks give it its restoration (13) and war-risk class only, with no (40) edge operation.
- The regime-C restoration (stream 10) is stored for a regional conflict whose region hosts a fab or an OSAT, the
  nodes that get (13) under §4.4, with or without a counterpart; elsewhere restoration is -1 and T0, tau_rho NaN.
- omega keeps every regional conflict while D_q = W0 u W1 of (40) reaches past the instant 0, counterpart -1
  included (``window_end``), so a dropped one began at least 104 weeks before 0 and the bound on its dropped (13) tail
  holds for both kinds.
- Piracy's ``rate`` is its drawn surcharge (the severity, U(0.08, 0.12)); tariffs carry the rate and severity 1.
- The weekly Poisson rate is the yearly rate / 52 (the design's year of 52 weeks, (28), §2.4); strikes are drawn
  only for active regions whose ports have a sea edge (``marks``' strike rule), since elsewhere a strike has no
  graph operation.
