"""The weekly cost C_t of (23) and the terminal credit S_T (design §3.6; Q3, Q56, Q58, Q68, Q73, Q79, Q93).

Every component is a ``math.fsum`` over explicit terms, with no ``@`` or ``np.dot`` (§3.6); C_t is the fsum of the
components and becomes integer cents once, by (24), in the caller. Flow terms are per (edge, commodity), with x_ek of
(52) the fsum of the week's lane flows x_ekl (``edge_flows``): exact and order-free, so the LP, which holds the same
pieces as lane columns (one aggregated column for a K^ov release), forms the same x_ek and the same cents (53). Tariffs
are charged in the dispatch week at the rate in force then, as ``(rate * v_k) * x_ek`` (Q58 E24, M8).
