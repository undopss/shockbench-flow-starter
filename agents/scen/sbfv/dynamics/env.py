"""Gymnasium-shaped environment without a gymnasium dependency (design §9.1, §9.3; Q68, Q86).

``Env.reset(instance, regime, omega, policy_seed) -> (obs, info)``; ``Env.step(action) -> (obs, reward, terminated,
truncated, info)`` with ``reward`` = r_t / 100 USD by (25) (integer cents in ``info["reward_cents"]``), ``terminated``
at T, ``truncated`` never set. ``info`` (local runs only) carries ``cost_components``, ``clipped``, ``invalid``,
``clamps``, ``edge_clamps`` (action slots) and ``override_clamps`` (override slots) (Q95). Actions are dicts of the
wire schema (§9.2): ``{"week", "flows": {"slot", "qty"}, "overrides": {"slot", "qty"} | None, "hold": {"chokepoint",
"k"} | None}``.

Readings chosen where §9.3 leaves room (conservative; design §12 'Phase-3 implementation notes'):

- Whole-week failures (``ValueError``, D9 fallback; design §12 "Whole-week failures"): the action is not a dict;
  ``week`` is missing, not an integer or not the week asked for; ``flows``, ``overrides`` or ``hold`` is present and
  not a dict of equal-length lists under the schema's keys (the reply cannot be paired into entries), a field holding
  a number without a JSON value (NaN, an infinity, an int or ``Fraction`` beyond the float range) included. A missing
  or null ``flows`` is an empty request (a missing slot is 0); a null ``overrides`` or ``hold`` is none.
- Entry rules, checked in this order, each entry dropped and logged on the first failure: the slot is not an integer
  index (bools are not), out of range, a duplicate (an earlier entry with the same slot passed these two checks,
  whatever its fate), the quantity is not a finite real number (bools are not), is negative, or the slot is masked
  this week (an override slot by its own (out-edge, k)). Hold entries
  must name a chokepoint node and a tanker commodity (K^ov, Q34); containerised cargo always follows the default.
- Log strings carry no value that JSON cannot hold, so replaying the stored (JSON-safe) actions reproduces them.
- The trajectory stores each action as received, made JSON-safe: non-finite floats, numbers that ``float()`` cannot
  convert (an int from about 1.8e308, a huge ``Fraction``) and containers nested deeper than 16 levels become ``None``,
  except that a ``flows``, ``overrides`` or ``hold`` value becomes the string ``"<TypeName>"`` of its type instead, so
  the field stays present and malformed on replay (M1 pre-gate round 2, INT-3); numpy scalars and arrays
  Python numbers, strs and lists (a str subclass, NumPy's included, its plain text); tuples lists; mapping keys strings
  (a str key its text, an int or bool key with a float value its decimal integer, any other key the string
  ``"<TypeName>"``); any other object the string ``"<TypeName>"`` of its type, never its ``repr``. An in-process
  reply that cannot be copied because a conversion raises (a ``numbers.Real`` whose ``float()`` raises ValueError, a
  Mapping whose iteration raises, anywhere in the reply) is stored whole as the string ``"<TypeName>"`` of the reply:
  not a dict, a whole-week failure, so ``step`` plays the fallback instead of raising and the stored copy fails the
  same way on replay (M1 pre-gate 3, INT-3). A whole-week failure is also logged as the first entry of
  ``StepRecord.invalid``.
- On a whole-week failure the environment plays ``fallback(obs)`` (the naive action from the policy's own observation
  of that week, D9, rebuilt from the unchanged state) when a fallback was given, else the empty action; a fallback
  that raises or itself fails validation is replaced by the empty action, and that failure is the second entry of
  ``StepRecord.invalid`` (only the exception's type when the fallback raised, so the record holds no arbitrary text).
- A snapshot carries the episode's fallback spec (``"naive"``, ``"naive_plain"``, a ``NaiveFallback``, None or the
  callable) and ``restore`` re-installs it for the restored episode, so a snapshot restored into an ``Env`` built with
  another fallback continues bit-identically (B2); a later ``reset`` installs the Env's own fallback again, so the same
  reset and policy give the same trajectory whether or not the Env restored a snapshot before (M1 pre-gate 3,
  DET-P3-3).
- The naive fallback is the end-aware naive (``policies.naive``, Q98; §9.3), the anchor's rule: ``"naive"`` and a
  ``NaiveFallback`` (``end_aware`` True by default). ``"naive_plain"`` and a ``NaiveFallback`` with
  ``end_aware=False`` play plain naive, the horizon-blind rule without the cut (tests and evidence only). The cut reads
  the observation's week alone, so a masked or blanked observation (M3) changes it no more than it changes naive.
- Naive's F_Q in the fallback (§8.1, §9.3): naive is a function of the instance and the generator only, so the
  fallback of a generated omega (``Omega.generated``: it stores regime paths) is naive with that generator's
  quantiles, received as the spec ``NaiveFallback`` (``policies.naive_fq.naive_fallback(inst, params)``, which carries
  the ``generator_id`` they belong to and the content digest of the instance they were computed for). ``reset`` refuses
  a ``NaiveFallback`` computed for other instance content (its ``instance_digest`` is not the instance's
  ``family_digest``, its content at its file's own rung, which F_Q reads, since it reads no stock (§12 'Warm start per
  rung'): a variant of other content keeps the hash label that ``generator_id`` reads, REG-M2R2-01; a spec
  built by hand without a digest binds no content and is checked by its generator only), one whose ``generator_id`` is
  not omega's (or that of omega's event-free twin (57)), a ``NaiveFallback`` on marks that record no generator
  (hand-built marks), and a string spec (``"naive"``, ``"naive_plain"``) on a generated omega, whose point mass at 0
  is the rule of injected lists only; a string spec on an injected list (or on marks without a generator) keeps the
  point mass at 0, so the frozen cents do not move. The guard reads the generator the marks record
  (``WeeklyMarks.generator_id`` and ``generated``, set by ``compute_marks`` from omega), so a reset from
  ``compute_marks(instance, omega)`` alone is checked exactly as one from omega (INT-M2-R1-1).
- ``reset`` and ``restore`` are atomic: the initial state, the observation, the Static tables and the fallback (naive's
  plan included) are built before anything is installed, so one that raises leaves the environment as it was
  (M1 pre-gate round 2, DET-P2-3).
- Observations are built fresh by ``observe`` and never aliased to the state, so the environment hands them out
  without copying and keeps none.
- One observation path (M3; design §5.4 "Rules"): ``reset`` resolves ``regime`` (a registry name or a theta of (47),
  ``information.theta.resolve_regime``), builds the episode's information view once (``information.view.build_view``,
  from omega and its marks, never the state), and every observation handed out, at reset, each step, to the D9
  fallback and after restore, is ``Env._observe(ep) = wrap_owned(observe(ep.inst, ep.marks, ep.state), ep.view,
  ep.inst)`` (``information.observe.wrap`` filling the fresh core observation in place), so the fallback sees exactly
  the policy's observation (under blackout the blanked one; Q71 X9). The view is shared
  by the episode's copies and snapshots like the instance and the marks, so ``restore`` rebuilds nothing from omega.
  ``Trajectory.regime`` records ``theta.regime_label`` (the registry name, or a custom theta's name and digest), and
  ``info["omega"]`` carries the omega payload under a theta that sees omega at reset (clairvoyant) only, built afresh
  (``wire.omega_payload``) from the view's public omega at each reset and restore.
- A step whose simulation, charge or observation raises marks the episode failed and re-raises: a valid action never
  makes the simulator raise (§9.3), so the exception is a bug, and the simulator may already have updated part of the
  week in place (shipments, lots, stocks). Later ``step`` and ``snapshot`` calls raise ``RuntimeError`` until ``reset``
  or ``restore`` (a snapshot taken before the failure continues bit-identically). Wherever the step failed (simulation,
  charge, terminal credit or observation), ``trajectory`` stores the failed week's action (as received, JSON-safe) as
  its last action and marks the week in ``Trajectory.failed``, while its records and terminal credit hold only the
  weeks completed before it; so replaying the stored actions in a fresh ``Env`` reproduces the failure, in the same
  week (M1 pre-gate 3, DET-P3-5). Validation and the fallback change nothing, so an exception there leaves the episode
  as it was and stores nothing.
