"""`chokepoint-small` and `chokepoint-full` built from spec §4.6-4.7 (design §2.1-2.3, §2.2; Q83, Q95; §12 M5 rows).

One table set describes `full`: spec §4.6's node rows (fictional firms at the spec's sites and classes, D5: ids name a
site and a class, never a company), region-pair routing rules, the compatibility, use and fab -> OSAT tables, planned
flow shares and scales, each scale with its tag. `small` is a named subset of the same tables (``SIZES``). The builder
turns the tables into a networkx ``MultiDiGraph`` (``build_graph``: parallel arcs are distinct keys, the edge ids),
then derives the instance dict of design §2.3 from it (``derive_instance_dict``): the reset-time flow (22) and the
chokepoint traffic mu_cb at a fixed point, d-bar = upsilon F-bar (22), pi by the Q85 rule, nu by the c^min rule of §11
row 1 (Q93), h = v r / 52, F^b (proposal K3), and the warm initial state of §2.3 (``warm_initial_state``). Every leaf
gets a provenance entry (V20): an explicit tag where the value is sourced or derived, else SYNTHETIC(placeholder), so
V23 refuses to seal a split of either size until the placeholders are replaced (§11 row 61).

The sourced scales (design §12 'M5 stream "instances"' rows) come from the committed M5 evidence, each constant naming
its script (``EVIDENCE``): the crude heat content (EIA MER), the terminals' LNG nameplates and the gas pipelines (GEM,
Q104), the fab capacities and the fab -> OSAT shares (SIA/BCG, the ATP shares by the owner's M5-O24 (b)) and the energy
source shares (BACI). mu_cb stays the instance's own traffic, the modelled share of the strait's volume (EIA,
PortWatch), which its provenance records (option 1, owner queue M5-O23). The chokepoint adjacency is the owner's M5-O8
(b) with the Turkish Straits weather-only (M5-O25 (b)); the turn-backs follow ``TURNBACK_CHOKEPOINTS`` (M5-O22's
default).

The warm start (§2.3) is built on naive's plan with the F_Q quantiles of each γ rung (design §12 'Warm start per rung',
owner queue M5-O37 (b)): ``data/warm_fq/<size>_g<rung>.json`` holds a rung's, computed on the point-mass build by
``rung_fq`` and checked against it by ``check_warm_fq``; without any file the builder takes the point mass (one start
for every rung). The file keeps one stock block per rung (``initial_state.stock`` the anchor rung's, named by
``initial_state.rung``, and ``initial_state.stock_by_rung`` the others'), one pipeline, WIP and queue block, and storage
caps sized on the largest block; ``Instance.at_rung`` puts a rung's block in the initial state. F_Q reads naive's plan,
mu and the reset pipeline and queues, never the warm stock, so one pass reaches the fixed point at every rung, which the
regeneration command checks by recomputing each rung's F_Q on the file it wrote. Each block is naive's event-free steady
state at its rung: (67) puts no closure term on a route into an OSAT or a fab, whose processing (12), (19) would take it
in week 1 (owner queue M5-O33 (b)).

Every grid buffers its gas by (16) with the days of cover D_g; every grid with a nuclear share also buffers its
nuclear fuel, 364 days of its requirement zeta G-bar^0 (``NUCLEAR_COVER_DAYS``; design §3.5 'Nuclear fuel cover',
the owner's answer of 2026-09-28), a buffer in naive's target (§8.1 step 3) and so in the warm stock; gas stays the
only rationed fuel (15).

The builder makes no random draw (stream 8, instance kind by seed index, stays reserved; naive's replications of the
F_Q file are stream 22's, drawn by the regeneration command, never by a rebuild). The committed ``data/small.json`` and
``data/full.json`` are the artefacts; the package never rebuilds them at runtime. Values that come from HiGHS (the
nominal flow and everything derived from it) may differ in their last bits across machines (Q94), so a rebuild
elsewhere is compared within a relative tolerance, never by hash.

Regenerate a file with ``uv run python -m sbfv.instance.flagship small`` (or ``full``), which reads the
committed F_Q files; ``--warm-fq`` first recomputes them (1,000 replications per the design, ``--warm-fq=R`` for R,
``--rungs=g,...`` only those rungs, ``--n-jobs=N`` joblib workers) and checks the fixed point at every rung. The command
prints the instance hash. The readings this module implements are the design §12 rows marked "M5 reading".

    naive's plan with the F_Q quantiles ``warm_fq`` and the storage caps. ``warm_fq`` keyed by ids (``fq_by_id``) is one
    start for every rung, None the point mass's; keyed by γ rung (the anchor rung among them) it is a warm start per
    rung (§2.3; M5-O37 (b)): the anchor rung's block in ``stock`` with ``rung``, the others' in ``stock_by_rung``, and
    the storage caps on the largest block. ``warm_note`` is the initial state's provenance source (default: the point
    mass's; one note per rung for a warm start per rung). Each step loads the dict with the package's loader, so every
    intermediate instance obeys §2.3.
