"""`nd`: naive with its closure term removed and a demand safety stock at sinks (M4, stream "heuristics").

Design §8.2 table, §7.2 (57); Q55, Q84, Q100 (3), Q100 (4).

S*_lk = (tau_l + 1 + o_l) d_lk + z_{pi/(pi+h)} sd_lk into a sink, sd_lk the SD of lead-time demand under (21) without
Xi; F_Q = 0 on every route; every other node, step and threshold is naive's (§8.1), the end-aware cut (71)-(72)
included, so nd differs from the anchor by its demand safety stock alone and (57) stays exact. Readings (design §12 M4
rows "nd" and "`nd` as built"):

- the sink level is the critical-ratio quantile of lead-time demand as §7.2 and §8.2 write it, without (67)'s cover
  cap (the owner's "Uncap nd's demand term", Q100 (4)): on `tiny`, where naive's cap binds at `sink_us` ((tau + 1) d
  = w^max d = 11,250), nd holds 14,233.91 there, above naive's level; every other route's level is naive's with
  F_Q = 0, cap included;
- sd_lk = (d_lk / d-bar) x the unconditional stationary SD of sum_{s < tau_l + 1 + o_l} d-bar exp(eps_s) under
  lognormal (21) without Xi, exact by the lognormal covariance, scaled by m^sea of the ordering week as naive's
  (tau + 1) d term is; z = ``statistics.NormalDist().inv_cdf`` of ``naive_fq.critical_ratio(inst, j, k)``;
- the week's targets reach naive's steps 4-6 through ``naive_action(..., targets=)`` (via ``end_aware_action``):
  naive's inventory position, split and route choice, bit for bit; nd is stateless.
