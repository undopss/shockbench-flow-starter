"""Public names of naive's own steps for the M4 naive-derived baselines (nd, sz_state_base_stock, human_ref, greedy_lp).

Design §8.1, §8.2; Q100 (3). Aliases of naive's private helpers, no new code: a baseline built from them differs from
the anchor by its named idea only, and naive's arithmetic, its plan cache and every frozen cent stay in
``policies.naive``. They live here, not at the end of ``naive.py``, so the M4 interface touches naive only by the
``targets`` keyword of ``naive_action``.
