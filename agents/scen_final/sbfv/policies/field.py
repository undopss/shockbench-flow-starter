"""The leaderboard field: participant-like entries between naive (RSS 0) and the best baseline (branch lb-field).

How many episodes the hackathon's boards need depends on the gaps between entries like a participant's, near-ties above
all, which the §2.6 baseline pairs and the kit's two samples (both below naive on `small` and `full`) do not show. The
field adds entries of two kinds, each built from a baseline's or the kit's real parameters:

- **same-family variants**, close to a baseline by construction: ``mpc_det`` with a fixed window of ``H_weeks`` weeks
  (the Q67 sweep only lengthens H from L) or with a safety factor on its point forecast (``WindowSpec``: the demand
  it plans for times ``demand_scale``, the chokepoint throughput times ``throughput_scale``); the existing parameters
  (``mpc_det``'s H and ``planning_rules``, ``greedy_lp``'s thresholds, ``human_ref``'s Sterman parameters) need no
  code here and are played as ``policy/`` configs;
- **different-mechanism entries**, for near-ties and a continuum of scores: ``BlendSpec``, which each week plays
  ``mpc_det``'s action with probability p and the kit heuristic's otherwise; and ``HeuristicSpec``, the kit heuristic
  (``docs/hackathon/samples/heuristic``) with its two SYNTHETIC constants changed, as a participant tuning the starting
  kit would. The tuning root showed those constants move the kit heuristic by at most 0.3 RSS, all of it below -1.7
  (docs/evidence/lb_field/explore_*_r1.txt), so no ``HeuristicSpec`` is in ``FIELD``: the field's tuned heuristic is
  ``human_ref`` with a tuned desired stock (``s_prime``), an existing parameter.

``FIELD`` names the entries the pilots play that need code here (``registry.FIELD`` lists the same names, so the
registry builds them by name without importing this module until then); ``build`` makes a policy of any spec (the
evidence scripts' candidates).

**Seeds** (as the kit agents'): each entry declares ``seed_id``, so the runner salts its policy seed with it
(``evaluation.runner.episode_policy_seed``, the trusted runner's rule (27) for a submission): a tuned heuristic's is the
SHA-256 of its submission zip (``kit_agents.build_zip`` of its ``agent.py``), any other entry's the SHA-256 of its
descriptor text (``descriptor``: this module, the name and the spec's repr), so a changed parameter is a changed seed.
A blend's weekly choices are drawn once at reset from that seed alone (``blend_coins``: numpy's ``SeedSequence`` of
(seed, ``BLEND_STREAM``)), so an episode's trajectory is the same in any process, worker or order (V1). ``provenance``
records the descriptor (and a tuned heuristic's files), which the runner writes into ``setup["policy_provenance"]``.

A blend runs both parts every week, so ``mpc_det``'s memory of the observed graph and its basis chain follow the
episode whichever action is played; its per-week CPU is ``mpc_det``'s plus the heuristic's. A heuristic week that
raises or returns a malformed action is null (the shim's rule), and a blend playing it passes the null on: the
environment's D9 fallback, as for a kit agent (§9.3).

Like the kit agents, these are the organisers' entries, played in the trusted process; the heuristic parts are read
from the checkout (``kit_agents.checkout_root``), so the entry points and the tests run from it.
