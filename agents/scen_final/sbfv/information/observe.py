"""The observation wrapper outside the environment core (design §5.1, §5.4 "Rules"; Q10, Q68 E13, Q71 X9).

``wrap(core_obs, view, inst)`` turns the core observation of ``dynamics.observe.observe`` (own state, ``graph_now``,
``slot_mask``, ``last_week``; the five feeds None) into theta's observation: it fills ``demand_forecast``
(``forecast.forecast_field``, which needs the instance's demands), ``warning``, ``messages``, ``pending_prohibitions``
and ``closure_end`` per theta from the view's reset-time tables (the last two read row t - 1 of the week tables
``build_view`` made once), nulls the coverage rung's masked ``graph_now`` entries (``coverage.mask_coverage``, on the
instance's graph, in place on its one private copy of the core observation), and in a blackout week nulls every
external feed (``EXTERNAL``) while keeping the own state and ``last_week``. It is pure: a fresh dict that aliases
neither the core observation nor the view. ``wrap_owned`` fills a core observation its caller owns in place instead
(the pair ``coverage.apply_coverage`` and ``coverage.mask_coverage`` make): ``Env._observe(ep) =
wrap_owned(dynamics.observe.observe(ep.inst, ep.marks, ep.state), ep.view, ep.inst)``, on the fresh dict ``observe``
builds, is the only observation path (reset, step, the D9 fallback, restore), so the fallback sees exactly what the
policy sees, the blanked observation under blackout (Q71 X9; threats row 5). The final observation (week T + 1) keeps
the own state and ``last_week`` with every external feed null (§12 "Observation contents").
