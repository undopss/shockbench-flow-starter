"""The flat view of §9.1: fixed-shape arrays for an observation and an action (design §9.1, §9.2; Q68, Q86, Q95).

No gymnasium here: the adapter ``shockbench_flow_gym`` builds its spaces from ``FlatLayout``. Readings of design §12
(M3 rows; the layout itself is the row "Flat view layout (M3 wire)"):

- Action: the flows vector over ``Static.action_slots`` in their fixed order (an entry of qty exactly 0 is not sent,
  since a missing slot is 0, so a masked slot at 0 logs nothing; any other value is sent and checked by §9.3), the
  override qty vector over ``override_slots``, and one release mode per (chokepoint, tanker commodity) pair:
  ``RELEASE_DEFAULT`` sends no override or hold entry for the pair, ``RELEASE_OVERRIDE`` sends every override slot of
  the pair (qty 0 included, which turns the default release off and releases nothing there), ``RELEASE_HOLD`` sends a
  hold entry. A fixed-length qty vector alone could not say 'no override'.
- Observation: blocks whose index set Static fixes are densified (stock by plain stock slot, backlog by demand,
  supply, prohibited and tariff as E x K, clip by action slot, forecast D x 8, warning over the R + D + C signal units
  of Static, whatever the regime, so a hidden ``Static.regime`` changes no shape: its observed-mask is 0 where
  ``warning`` is null);
  variable-length blocks (pipeline, queue_lots, wip, messages, pending_prohibitions, and closure_end, one entry per
  closure event since several closures can act on one chokepoint at once) are padded to a cap per instance kind
  (``maxima_for``; M5 stream "wire") that raises on overflow and never truncates, a caller's ``maxima`` overriding it.
  Each null becomes 0 with a 0 in its field's observed-mask. On `small` and `full` (``GROUPED_KINDS``; M5-O35 (c),
  design §12 "Flat view grouped lists (M5 wire3)") the pipeline is grouped first (``group_rows``): one entry per
  (edge, k, lane, arrival_week), qty the exact sum of the group's. There the queue lots are a dense block (M5-O38 (b),
  design §12 "Flat view dense queue lots (M5 wire4)"; ``dense_lots``): ``queue_lots.qty`` of shape
  (len(``FlatLayout.lot_keys``), T), one row per (chokepoint, k, lane, next_edge) a lot can hold, one column per
  arrival week 1..T, each cell the exact sum of its lots, observed where lots wait; the lots' index fields go. The
  §9.2 lists stay in the observation.
- The action mask is 1 = valid (the inverse of the wire's ``slot_mask``, True where an edge of the slot's route is
  prohibited for its commodity, Q111); in a blackout week (``slot_mask`` null) it is all-valid with its observed-mask 0.
- The override mask is 1 = valid per override slot, 0 where the slot's own (out-edge, k) is prohibited this week (the
  entry §9.3 drops), from ``graph_now.prohibited``; all-valid with its observed flag 0 when ``graph_now`` is null (M5
  re-gate INT-M5R-03, design §9.1). Neither mask is a wire field.

Keys are the §9.2 paths of the leaf fields in §9.2 order (``graph_now.kappa.tb``), each followed by
``<path>.observed`` (int8, 1 where the value is present); float64 quantities, int64 indices, weeks and vocabulary codes
(the index in the frozen tuple), int8 for the booleans ``prohibited`` and ``slot_mask``.

Caps (design §12 "Flat view layout (M3 wire)", "Flat caps per instance kind (M5 wire)" and "Flat view grouped lists
(M5 wire3)"). Three structural bounds are proved. wip holds one entry per fab and start week in the last tau^fab
weeks, booked at every start even when nothing starts (12), and one per OSAT, out week in the next tau^osat weeks and
package, booked for every package pair (19), so its length is ``wip_bound`` in every week once the initial state fits
it. Grouped, pipeline and queue_lots have bounds too, since lead times are fixed (Q87): a dispatch or release of week
d >= 1 on edge e arrives in d + tau_e (2), so the observation of week t holds at most tau_e arrival weeks per (edge, k,
lane) (``pipeline_bound``), and a lot at chokepoint c on lane l arrived in a week of [1 + tau of l's edge into c, T]
(``queue_lots_bound``, the cells a lot can occupy), besides the initial state's. `small` and `full` pad wip and the
pipeline to their bounds, and ``FlatLayout.from_static`` refuses a cap below one; their dense queue lots have a cell
for every lot, so no cap. The feed blocks have none to prove: ``messages`` holds the live
threads among omega's real and shadow ones, ``pending_prohibitions`` holds one entry per (event, edge, k) and
``closure_end`` one per closure event acting at t - 1, and the generator's event and shadow counts are Poisson and
Hawkes draws with unbounded support. Nor have the lists of pipeline and queue_lots a useful one: a chokepoint's lots
grow by one per arriving shipment for as long as it stays closed or held, and each lot released in pieces sends one
shipment per piece (§3.4). So those caps are measured maxima with the margin 2: `tiny`'s feed caps over its generated
episodes (M3 attempt 1's gate, INT-M3-01, where the placeholders 256 / 128 / 16 raised from rung 0.79 up), `tiny`'s
own-state caps SYNTHETIC(placeholder), and the feed caps of `small` and `full` over their generated episodes at every
rung (``scripts/python/evidence/flat_caps.py generated``). The messages block carries only the live threads
(``live_messages``, Q105), while the §9.2 observation keeps the cumulative list, whose longest measured list (`tiny`
6,364, `full` 11,856) would need a cap of 12,736 (23,744) by the same rule.
