"""The reset-time min-cost flow of (22): nominal delivered flows and the routes of naive's plan (design §3.6, §8.1).

At nominal capacities (u^0, kappa = k_c mu, supply availabilities, fab cap^0, OSAT thr), the steady weekly flow that
delivers the most packaged chips to the sinks and, among those, costs least in freight; grids receive their fuel burn
zeta_gk G-bar^0_g. F-bar_ik (22) is the packaged-chip flow into sink i; the routes (lanes through chokepoints, or single
internal edges) and their flows are what naive's step 1 plans on. Solved lexicographically with ``linprog``
(``highs-ds``): first the delivery, then the cost at that delivery (design §12, "Reset-time flow (22)"; Q84).

The static weekly LP (one variable per flow, no time index):

- ``x_ek`` on every non-coupling edge whose tail and head are not chokepoints, per permitted k not prohibited at reset;
- ``y_lk`` per lane and commodity permitted on every edge of the lane, no (edge, k) of the lane prohibited at reset.
  Cargo crosses chokepoints only on lanes (the queue keeps each lot's lane, §3.4), so an edge into or out of a
  chokepoint carries only lane flow, and a turn-back edge on no lane carries nothing (it needs an override, which the
  nominal flow and naive never use);
- supply lifts ``s_ik`` <= the availability varsigma-bar^0_ik at supply nodes (unlifted availability is lost, Q79);
- fab starts ``p_f`` <= cap^0_f: a wafer in is a raw chip out (no scrap at nominal);
- OSAT packaging ``xi_ik`` per raw chip k, sum over k <= thr_i: a raw chip in is a packaged chip out;
- sink deliveries ``D_ik`` per sink demand.

Rows: flow balance (in - out + lift + production - consumption - delivery = requirement) at every non-chokepoint node
and commodity, the requirement being zeta_gk G-bar^0_g for grid g's fuel k and 0 elsewhere (steady state: nothing
accumulates, nothing is disposed of); the joint capacity u^0_e of each edge over commodities and lanes (4); the
chokepoint throughput k_c mu_cb per pool b over the lanes through c (9) at open fraction 1. Stage 1 maximises
sum D; stage 2 minimises freight sum c^0_e (flow on e) with the row sum D >= D* of stage 1 added.

Readings (design §12 "Reset-time flow (22), formulation"): freight is c^0 on the flow on each edge, a lane paying for
every edge it uses (war-risk transit costs and tariffs are 0 at reset with no events). The §2.3 tables
``compatibility`` (source -> terminal) and ``use`` (material -> fab) are not read here, since the loader checks that the
edges and lanes realise exactly those pairs (``instance.io._check_tables``, §2.2): an edge or lane from a source to a
terminal, or from a material to a fab, whose pair its table does not list, or a listed pair that no edge or lane joins,
never loads, so the routes the edges, their permitted commodities and the lanes allow join exactly the tables' pairs.
Terminals conserve flow and their throughput is the capacity of their grid edge (§2.1). Routes are read from the
positive flows: a lane route per ``y_lk`` and an edge route per ``x_ek``, both ending at their destination node. Flows
at or below ``FLOW_TOL`` (a numerical tolerance, not a model parameter) are treated as zero.
