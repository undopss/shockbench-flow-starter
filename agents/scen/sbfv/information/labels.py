"""Onset labels of the warning signal's units, for V27 and the per-episode eta_n (design §5.2 "Labels"; Q80).

Readings of design §12 (M3 rows), in the alignment of ``scripts/python/evidence/f3_mc.py``:

- Region and dyad units (``chain_labels``): a chain's onset week is s with z^{s-1} = none and z^s != none (the step
  from column s - 1 to s reads the hazard of week s - 1, (29)). Score week t (column t + B) is a none-week iff
  z[t + B] = none, and label_h(t) = 1 iff an onset week lies in (t, t + h]. A region unit reads its own chain
  (omega's ``z_c_own``), never the effective layer: an onset a dyad war forces belongs to the dyad unit. A dyad unit
  reads its ``z_dyad`` row (0 = at peace).
- Chokepoint units (``chokepoint_labels``): week t is a none-week iff no militarised closure (type 3) on c acts in
  [t - 1, t) (f^t_q = 0 of (37)); weather closures (type 7) exclude no week; label_h(t) = 1 iff a militarised closure
  on c has its onset week floor(t_on) + 1 in (t, t + h]. It takes an event list and a week range, since V27's
  chokepoint worlds are long-horizon, not omega's T weeks.
- A week whose horizon t + h runs past the span is invalid (censored). h = 13 is declared (46); h in {1, 4, 13, 52}
  is reported (V27 (iii)).

eta_n (the per-episode Brier score of §5.4) is logged by the evaluation runner (M4/M6), from these labels and
``z_c_own``; M3 supplies both (design §12 M3 row).
