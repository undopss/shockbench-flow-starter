"""`sz_state_base_stock`: base stock conditioned on the observed chokepoint state and queue (M4, "heuristics").

A base-stock vector per risk bucket, (R2.7) conditioned on the observed chokepoint state and queue (design §8.2
table; Song-Zipkin 1996; R2 §2.5; Q17, Q100 (3)).

The rule as read (design §12 M4 rows "sz_state_base_stock" and "`sz_state_base_stock` as built"): naive's plan,
steps 4-6, cover cap and end-aware cut (71)-(72), with the closure term of (67) on each lane route through (c, b)
replaced each week by the critical-ratio quantile of (66) run forward from the observed pool queue:

- bucket of c at week t: "closed" if ``graph_now.open[c]`` <= ``closed_threshold`` (0.6, naive's cut), "open" above
  it, "unobserved" when null (blackout, coverage);
- Q_obs = the summed qty of ``queue_lots`` at c whose commodity is in pool b;
- the conditional law pools ``naive_fq.backlog_path(Q_obs, d_cb m^sea(t), k_c mu_cb, o^tr[r, s:s+H])`` over the
  replications r and start weeks s whose o^tr_{c, s-1} lies in the week's bucket, H = tau_l + 1 truncated at T; o^tr
  are the transient paths of naive's own stream-22 replications (``transient_paths``: ``naive_fq.replication_opens``,
  one ``sampler.sample_closures`` draw per replication read by every pair, owner queue M5-O21 (b), bit-identical to the
  ones behind F_Q);
- a route into a fab or an OSAT carries no closure term, as in naive's (67) (1^cl = 0,
  ``naive.carries_closure_term``; owner queue M5-O33 (b)), since sz replaces naive's term route by route;
- the closure term is (d_lk / d_cb) x ``naive_fq.quantile(law, CR_jk)``, capped by w^max as naive's level; an
  unobserved bucket, or one matching no replication week, falls back to naive's unconditional quantile
  (``context.fq_quantile``); on an injected list (no generator, no paths) sz equals naive's actions.

Prediction-free observables only, so it acts alike in every regime; warning-score buckets are ``hamilton_filter``'s
role, not M4's. The transient paths are never constructor state (1,000 x 26 x 2 floats pickle to about 416 kB, near
macOS's argument limit as hex): ``reset`` reads them from the per-process cache ``_PATHS`` that the runner seeds
(``remember_paths``).

Reset on a cache miss (design §12 M4 row "sz_state_base_stock"): with ``context.generator`` set, ``reset`` looks the key
(instance content digest, ``generator_id(context.generator.params(inst), inst)``, ``context.fq_replications``) up in
the ``_PATHS`` dict directly, never through ``transient_paths``, so a runner task whose parent seeded the cache never
calls ``transient_paths`` (``tests/test_m4_runner.py`` patches it to raise inside tasks). On a miss it reads the file
``context.paths_file`` names when one is given (``load_paths``: the parent's paths as public data, ``save_paths``),
which is how the wire entry point's ``child_argv`` child gets them (INT-M4-02: drawing 1,000 stream-22 replications per
pair in the child took minutes, all counted against week 1, and naive played every week); otherwise it calls
``transient_paths(inst, context.generator.params(inst), context.fq_replications)`` (serial), which fills the cache: the
consumers that seed nothing and name no file (``scripts/python/run_episode.py``, V24 replays, the joblib workers of a
generated V5 test) compute the paths in the process, bit-identical to the seeded ones. With ``context.generator`` None
nothing is read or computed and sz equals naive.
