"""The announcement stage of the generator: leads, shadow events and blackout spells (design §4.1, §5.3; (26), (49)).

Three keyed draws (27), all into omega, none at reset or in a week (so every regime of an episode shares them:
pairing at the path level, R5.11), and none inside ``sampler.sample_closures`` (naive's F_Q stays bit-identical):

- **Leads** (stream 4, key (*event key, channel)): every stored event of an announced type gets a lead on each
  channel of its type's set (``codes.TYPE_CHANNELS``, which ``InformationParams.channels`` equals; symmetric sets,
  Q97) by inversion, l_q = F^{-1}_ch(V_q) (49), in weeks: a tariff a proposal (key (*key, 0), two uniforms: informal
  iff the first is < ``informal_share`` = 25/57, its lead in column tariff_informal, else tariff_formal; the second its
  lead uniform) and a final notice (key (*key, 2)); a sanction or export control a TIES threat (key (*key, 4)) and a
  legal publication (key (*key, 3)); a militarised closure a MID threat (key (*key, 5)). ``ev_lead`` (events, 6)
  holds them, NaN on every other channel; ``V_lead`` (events,) keeps the signed-off §4.1 shape and holds the uniform of
  the event's decoy-bearing channel (proposal, TIES or MID), NaN for other events. A tariff's final notice never comes
  before its proposal (Q12.3's order): its lead is min(F^{-1}_final(its own uniform), the proposal's lead); a
  sanction thread's two leads are independent draws (design §12 "Messages", "Stream 4, the leads"). A lead mode other
  than 'record' cannot re-invert the second notice or a shadow lead from omega, so it redraws omega (design §12 M3
  row). Leads never enter the marks (``marks.read_events`` reads the scalar columns only), so J, the oracle and every
  frozen cent are unchanged (V3).
- **Shadows** Y (stream 7; (49) as Q101 amends it): a second cluster process of (30), the real one's law with every
  immigrant rate times k*, the largest shadow threads per real event of an announced type (``type_odds``): the same
  immigrant parts (the Q51 closure modulation g(X_c)/c_X included), branching matrix Gamma (31), kernel beta
  e^{-beta s} and typing rule (``events.type_parts``, the one composition of ``targets.TypeRules``, built once per
  episode, SIMP-M2R2-05), over the burn-in and the episode. Shadows excite shadows only, and real events never
  excite shadows: the real genealogy does not enter Y, so a shadow thread's children are announced and thinned like a
  real thread's (``shadow_cascade``). Keys are stream 1's layout on stream 7 (``SH_COUNT`` .. ``SH_DELAY``; a
  shadow's key is its genealogy, as a real event's). A shadow of an announced type y with its effect instant in
  [0, T) becomes a decoy thread when its cluster's uniform U_c (key (``SH_CLUSTER``, *immigrant key), shared by every
  member of the cluster) times k*/k_y is below 1; that product is U_decoy, the thinning uniform of (49), so a cluster
  keeps its members of one type together and each channel keeps its phi-bar in expectation (a tariff's proposal
  channel is drawn with the informal odds p k_informal/k_T, which keeps both proposal channels at their own
  phi-bar under one threshold). Every other shadow is latent: never stored, never shown. The marks come from key
  (``SH_MARKS``, *shadow key), a fixed vector of ``SHADOW_UNIFORMS`` uniforms: the type, the target (a real event's
  rule: a closure immigrant's part fixes its chokepoint, else ``TypeRules.candidates``), the proposal channel, the
  rate (a tariff's by tension state), the thread's leads on every channel of its type's set (the final notice capped
  at the proposal's lead, as for real threads), and a duration and severity from the type's laws (never acted on, so
  every sh_* row passes the one event writer and ``marks.read_events(prefix='sh')``; design §12 "Stream 7, the
  shadows"). Offspring counts by inversion are non-decreasing in Gamma, so the shadows nest across gamma rungs like
  the real events (V2), and across phi (CRN of (49)); a larger k* redraws them (design §12 rows "Shadows and V2's
  subset rule", "A larger phi-bar redraws Y").
- **Blackout spells** (stream 11, key (spell kind)): one spell per kind of ``codes.BLACKOUT_SPELLS``, stored in kind
  order in ``blk_start`` and ``blk_end`` (weeks blk_start <= t < blk_end; to_end ends at T + 1), the onset uniform over
  the admissible weeks by one uniform (``InformationParams.blackout_onset``, SYNTHETIC(placeholder); design §12
  "Stream 11, the blackout spells").

The event-free twin (57) keeps the shadow group, X, W and z_c_own and empties ``ev_lead`` and ``V_lead``
(``omega.injected.event_free``); an injected omega stays as today (every lead NaN, no shadow, no spell, no M3 array).
