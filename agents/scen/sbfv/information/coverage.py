"""The spatial-coverage rung (design §5.3 table; Q10, Q38 C10; W2-information §2.3).

Prediction-free, with the graph state shown only within ``h_cov`` hops of the policy's goods (Canadian traveller
regime at 0, stochastic CTP at 1). Readings of design §12 (M3 rows), the metric R9 of the observation map:

- Anchors at the instant t - 1, read from the core observation: the nodes holding the policy's stock or WIP (a
  nonzero quantity: the observation lists every WIP ledger row, and the simulator books a fab's row every week, even
  one that starts no lot, so a zero row holds none of the policy's goods; SPEC-M3-01), the edges carrying its
  pipeline shipments and the chokepoints holding its queue lots.
- Distance on the undirected supply graph, chokepoints counting as edges (a chokepoint and its incident edges are one
  element): an element carrying goods, or an edge whose tail node is an anchor, is at distance 0; any other element at
  1 + the least node distance of its endpoints to an anchor. So at h_cov = 0 an edge is seen from its tail node.
- Shown iff d <= h_cov. Masked (null) outside, exactly: ``graph_now.u``, ``c`` and ``tau`` per edge and the chokepoint
  state ``open``, ``kappa`` and ``war_risk``; every other field (prohibited, tariff, supply, fab, grid, osat,
  slot_mask, the own state) is kept. Plant damage is public (Q97), so neither ``graph_now.fab`` nor ``graph_now.osat``
  is masked; the blackout rung blanks both with the rest of ``graph_now``.

On ``tiny`` nearly every node holds goods and src_gulf -> chk shows chk at h = 0, so the rung is near-degenerate there;
its tests use constructed states (risk of the observation map).
