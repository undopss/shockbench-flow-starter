"""Harm of an event and of an episode, (41)-(43) (design §4.5; Q41, Q50, Q61, Q76 owner D7).

H_q = u-bar_q T^in_q x (sigma_q v-bar_q for capacity events and prohibitions: lost capacity-weeks valued in USD;
Delta c_q for cost events: tariffs tau^tar v_k, piracy 0.08-0.12 c^0_e), summed over the event's targets; T^in_q is
the part of its window D_q inside the episode [0, T) (for a war profile W0 u W1 of (40), Q87); u-bar_q is the target's
nominal weekly capacity (sum_b k_c mu_cb at a chokepoint with each pool valued at its own v-bar; u^0_e on an edge or
for a prohibited pair; cap^0_f at a fab; thr_i at an OSAT; the supply rate at a supply node; G-bar^0_g at a grid);
v-bar_q is the mean customs value v_k of the commodities the target carries at reset. H(omega) = sum_q H_q (42),
capacity and cost harm 1:1 in USD; H_ty (43) per type label (``totals`` gives all three from one pass). The affected
targets are those of ``marks`` (one rule table, V3), read through its public API (``read_events``, ``graph_marks``,
``event_capacity_marks``). V17's capacity-loss share reads the same valuation week by week (``capacity_loss_share``,
re-exported by ``realism``), the node targets by the same loss rule (``_node_losses``).

How the rule table is reused, event by event (each event alone, so no other event's product (37) enters):

- Capacity: ``marks``' own week averages of the event over the weeks 1..T: an edge, open fraction, supply slot or
  grid loses sigma^t f^t per week by (37) and (40), so the sum over weeks of (nominal - marked) is u-bar sigma T^in,
  the war profile's two severities included; a fab's loss is the sum over weeks of 1 - R_f(t) of (13), the dead time
  and the restoration tail, the same integral of sigma theta_q(s) over [0, T); an OSAT's loss is the sum over weeks
  of 1 - R_osat(t) of (13) on the OSATs of m_q of a regional conflict (§4.4), u-bar = thr_i, by the same rule.
  Friendly fire (37) is a capacity cut.
- Prohibitions and cost marks (binary marks (1)): the pairs, tariff rates and piracy surcharges that ``marks`` puts
  in force for the event at full force (a probe week inside its window), times the continuous T^in of D_q =
  [onset, onset + T_q), as (41) is written. Only three types put these marks in force (§4.4 type table): sanctions
  and export controls (Z_t), tariffs and piracy (``BINARY_TYPES``); the probe runs for them alone, since for every
  other type it finds nothing.

Valuation, where §4.5 leaves the reading open (reported for design rows): the commodities an edge carries at reset are
K_e less its pairs in Z_0 (so a pair prohibited from week 0 harms nothing, and an edge carrying nothing has no
harm); a prohibited or taxed pair (e, k) takes the equal share u^0_e / |K^0_e| of the edge's capacity at v_k, so a
whole-edge prohibition is u^0_e v-bar_e; piracy's u-bar is u^0_e on an edge that carries something at reset; the
commodities a node carries are those of its stock slots (a chokepoint pool's v-bar is the mean over its slots of
that pool, a fab's over its wafer input and raw-chip output); an OSAT's v-bar is the mean v_k of the raw chips it
packages (the keys of ``packages``; on `tiny` raw and packaged chips are both 20,000 USD); a supply slot is a target
of its own, supply rate x v_k.
