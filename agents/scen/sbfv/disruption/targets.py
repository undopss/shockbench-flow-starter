"""Event types and targets per region: the type law and target rules of design §4.4 and the §2.4 `tiny` profile.

One module decides, for an event of block B in region m at a week with regime (z^c, z^p), which types are feasible,
with which weights, and which targets each type can hit. The cluster sampler (``hawkes``) reads it for the immigrant
intensity of the militarised block, whose closure part is modulated by the chokepoints' latent risk (Q51); the event
stage (``events``) reads it to type every event. Both therefore agree by construction.

Rules (design §2.4 profile, "Type laws per block" and "Targets"):
- a type with no target in the region is infeasible; a regional conflict is feasible exactly in the war state
  (z^c = 2), where it always has a candidate (below); feasible weights are renormalised; a block with no feasible type
  leaves its event without a graph operation (a no-op event: it keeps its place in the genealogy of (30), but omega
  does not store it);
- targets: closure and piracy an adjacent chokepoint (uniform); tariff (importer m, exporter uniform among regions
  with a non-coupling edge into m, then commodity uniform among the commodities of that exporter's edges into m);
  sanction an edge from m into another region (uniform, all of K_e); material outage a material node in m; energy
  shock a grid in m; regional conflict its own region with a counterpart: a partner of a dyad at war with m in the
  week (uniform among several, Q59), which takes precedence, else a region drawn with weight A_{m m'}, else none
  (counterpart -1, Q94 (f)). Tariff and sanction targets count an edge's commodities less its pairs prohibited from
  week 0 (Z_0 of (3), in force all episode; `tiny`'s E7), since an event on such a pair has no effect (reported
  reading).
- Q114, the sanction target rules of `small` and `full` (design §2.4 "Targets" and "Type laws per block", §12 row
  "Sanction target rules V3 (Q114)"), read from ``params.targeting`` (``params.TargetingRules``; None, `tiny`'s, keeps
  the rules above): V1 drops every sanction candidate whose tail is a chokepoint (a transit leg is not an export of the
  chokepoint's coastal region); V2 keeps the policy block's (block P) infeasible share as one no-op part (-1) after the
  feasible types, each at its raw share over the block's full share total, instead of renormalising (a block with no
  feasible type stays one no-op event). The militarised block and the tariff rule are unchanged.
- A regional conflict's candidates are its counterparts: the partners of the dyads at war with m in the week, else
  the regions with A_{m m'} > 0, else (a war-state region with neither, Q94 (f)) the single target (m, counterpart
  -1), which acts through its restoration (13) and war-risk class only, with no (40) edge operation (``marks``). A
  dyad war thus gives a region without trade partners its conflict against the dyad partner (CMP-1), and a war of its
  own chain a partnerless one. The regime state of a (region, column) is ``TypeRules.state``: the effective z^c, which
  sets the feasible types, and those dyad partners, which name the counterpart.

**One immigrant-parts rule** (30), Q51, composed once, in ``TypeRules``: ``TypeRules.week_parts`` gives the typed
parts of a (block, region, week), read at the week's column t + B_burn of the regime paths: the effective conflict
layer z^c (dyad wars applied) sets the feasible types (``TypeRules.parts``, the memoised ``immigrant_parts``; since a
regional conflict at war always has a candidate, Q94 (f), neither the week's dyad partners nor A change them), and
every militarised-closure part aimed at chokepoint c is multiplied by g(X^t_c)/c_X of the week
(``closure_modulation``, applied by ``modulate``). ``TypeRules.week_totals`` is the ``math.fsum`` of those shares per
week, and the cluster sampler's immigrant intensity is lambda^0 of the week's regime times it
(``hawkes.immigrant_rates``); the event stage types an immigrant by the same parts at the week of its key (block,
region, t + B_burn, rank), so the intensity and the type law agree by construction. The module's ``week_parts`` is
``TypeRules.week_parts`` for one call. The adjacency A has one rule too (``adjacency_dict``): the params' A when set,
else the instance's. A child event belongs to its onset week t = floor(s) + 1.
