"""Integer codes of the omega container and the seed keys, frozen with schema_version 1 (design §4.1; Q86, Q87).

Every categorical key component is a 0-based index; regions, nodes, edges, lanes and commodities are positions in the
instance file's lists. Any change here bumps ``schema_version``. ``UNIT_KINDS`` and ``MESSAGE_KINDS`` are two §9.2
vocabularies of schema 1 (Q86) that milestone M3 defines here, their one home (every module imports them from here):
the design froze them at version 1, so defining them bumps nothing. ``TYPE_CHANNELS`` and ``DECOY_CHANNELS`` are the
channel sets Q97 fixes (symmetric decoys), frozen here for the same reason.
