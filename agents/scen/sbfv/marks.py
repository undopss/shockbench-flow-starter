"""Weekly marks: omega -> the arrays the simulator and the oracle LP both read (design §3.1, §3.4, §3.5, §4.4; V3).

This is the **one module** that turns the exogenous scenario into weekly edge weights and capacities (V3, R1 practice
2): the simulator (`dynamics/`) and the LP (`oracle/`) never read events themselves; they read a `WeeklyMarks`.

Timing (1), Q69: week t covers [t-1, t). *Week averages* over [t-1, t) (capacities, open fractions, availability,
deliverable energy, base load, restoration, ceiling) are pro-rated by the overlap rule (37); *binary marks*
(prohibitions, tariffs, piracy surcharge, war-risk class) are in force in week t iff w(s) <= t < w(s_end), with
w(s) = ceil(s) + 1; *instantaneous* values at the instant t-1 feed the observation of week t (`*_now`).

Array convention: axis 0 is the week, index t-1 for week t = 1..T. Other axes use the instance's integer codes: edges
E, commodities K, stock slots S (``Instance.stock_slots`` order), and the ordinals of chokepoints C, grids G, fabs F and
demands D (``Instance.demands`` order). Pools are (tb, ct) = (0, 1).

Readings of the §4.4 type table where the design leaves the rule open (conservative choices, milestone M1):

- Regions of nodes are their instance regions, chokepoints included (`chk` is GULF). "An edge between regions A and B"
  has one end in A and the other in B, either direction; coupling edges (mode grid) take no mark and keep u = inf.
- Time-varying severity (war profile (40)): the week factor is 1 - ∫σ_q(s) ds over the week's part of D_q, the (37)
  pro-rating with σ^t_q f^t_q read as an integral, so a week straddling W0 and W1 loses 0.60 f0 + 0.73 f1.
- Regional conflict: a region target only (m_q is that region; any other target kind raises); edge operations only
  with a drawn counterpart (none if -1); the war-risk class uses the event's own duration window [on, on + T_q) and the
  fab hits the dead-time window [on, on + T0) (T0 falling back to T_q when NaN), both on the event region m_q only
  (not the counterpart); the fab severity is the event's ``severity``. The CN–TW Taiwan Strait closure and the
  demand shock Xi are not marks here
  (the closure is its own event; Xi is in omega's ``d``).
- Fab events E_f: only regional conflicts act on fabs, on the fabs of m_q (§4.4; no other type has a fab operation).
  An event with target kind node on a fab applies its own graph operation, or raises if its type defines none. Dead
  time T0 falls back to the event duration when NaN.
- OSAT restoration (§4.4: "fabs and OSATs in m_q get (13)"; milestone M2, design §12 'OSAT restoration under a
  regional conflict'): ``R_osat`` (T, O) is (13)'s restoration factor on every OSAT of m_q of every regional conflict,
  by the rule of R_f and the same helpers (the event's severity, dead time T0 falling back to T_q, tail tau_rho, shape
  g_rho; several conflicts multiply in row order, (37)), with or without a counterpart; no other type acts on an OSAT.
  It scales the throughput of (19), thr_i R_osat_i(t), in the simulator and the LP alike. OSATs get no ceiling
  alpha-bar and no scrap (14): the design gives OSATs neither.
- Scrap (14): only hits inside the episode scrap, onset instant in (0, T): carried-in events (onset <= 0) scrap
  nothing, not even initial WIP (§2.3), and no scrap is booked after T, so the WIP credit of (23) is net of scrap
  booked by T in the simulator and the LP alike (Q56). ``fab_hits`` holds exactly those hits.
- War-risk class: from active events only (Q43): militarised closures on c and regional conflicts in a region adjacent
  to c; the conflict layer z_c alone sets no class, so omega^0 has class none throughout (57).
- Friendly fire: the dyad is (m_q, counterpart) for the region variant, (target node's region, counterpart) for the
  node variant (counterpart -1: every other region; the event's own region plays no part there) and (tail region, head
  region) for the edge variant; the sanctioned set is the event commodity, else K_e of the target edge (edge variant)
  or every commodity (then no edge escapes and no friendly fire applies).
- Tariffs and sanctions mark (e, k) only for k in K_e; with chokepoints in their node region, a TW tariff on GULF also
  taxes `chk` -> `grid_tw` cargo that entered `chk` from RU (edge-based tariffs do not track origin). A node sanction
  covers the node's out-edges into the counterpart, or into every *other* region when it is -1 (as the region variant
  and the friendly-fire dyad read -1), so an out-edge inside the node's own region stays open. A tariff rate is >= 0.
- Piracy multiplies c on every edge into or out of each targeted chokepoint (the region's chokepoints by
  ``chokepoint_adjacency``), so a whole transit costs (1 + rate) more; when the rate is NaN the factor is 1 + severity.
  The surcharge (the rate, or the severity without one) is >= 0, so no freight turns negative.
- Event fields: NaN means absent where a rule reads it so (the piracy rate, T0, tau_rho, and any field a type does not
  read); onset and duration are required. An infinite field raises ValueError instead of being read as NaN: the design
  gives infinity no reading, and the injected builder cannot store it.
- ``MarkParams`` refuses values outside their ranges when built (ValueError naming the field): the Hormuz-2026
  threshold, the war-profile losses (40) and sigma_ff lie in [0, 1], the war-profile window is a finite number of
  weeks > 0, the restoration shape is 'exp' or 'linear'; NaN, bools and strings in numeric fields are refused.
- Port strike: sea edges with a non-chokepoint end in the struck region (region target) or at the struck node.
- Restoration (13): the closed form of the week average theta-bar is clipped to [0, 1], the range of theta_q, since
  the dead-time share plus the tail rounds one or two ulps above 1 for a huge tau_rho (about 1e15 weeks and more); so
  every factor 1 - sigma_q theta-bar, R_f, R_osat and R_now included, lies in [0, 1] (ORACLE-M2-1).
- The stored ``R_f``, ``R_osat``, ``alpha_bar`` and ``sigma_scr`` of omega (26), when present, are the realisation the
  marks carry (owner decision Q91, option (a)): ``compute_marks`` reads them bit for bit and checks each entry against
  its recomputation from the events under omega's ``MarkParams``, |stored - recomputed| <= 1e-9 max(1, |recomputed|),
  the row tolerance of (53) (``STORED_MARK_TOL``), so an omega built where libm rounds exp or expm1 of (13) one ulp
  apart is accepted as stored, while arrays stored under other parameters (off far beyond it) are refused with
  ValueError (V3) and never mix with ``R_now`` and the fab hits recomputed here. A stored ``R_f`` or ``R_osat`` must
  also lie in [0, 1], the range of (13)'s factors, however close to its recomputation. The integer ``wr_class`` must
  equal its recomputation exactly. ``alpha_now`` is the week array shifted by one week. Without stored arrays the
  recomputation is the realisation.
- A target kind that the type table does not define for a type raises ValueError rather than being ignored.
- omega must carry ``meta_instance_hash``, ``meta_instance_digest`` and ``meta_mark_params`` (every builder writes
  them): the marks are bound to the instance content and to omega's own parameters, never to a caller's pick (V3).
- ``WeeklyMarks`` are immutable: every array is a private read-only copy over an immutable buffer, so the cached
  ``digest`` always states the content the simulator and the LP read (V3 by content).

The disruption stage reads events through the same rules, never a copy of them: ``read_events`` (omega's rows as
``Event``), ``graph_marks`` and ``restoration_factors`` (the marks of a set of events over weeks 1..T),
``event_capacity_marks`` (the capacity marks of one event alone), ``fab_targets`` and ``osat_targets`` (who a
restoration event hits), ``restoration_regions`` (the regions whose conflicts get (13)), ``strike_edges`` (where a port
strike acts) and ``war_windows`` (the windows of (40)). Harm (41), the realism overlap count, the event stage and the
Poisson components' strike rule use them.
