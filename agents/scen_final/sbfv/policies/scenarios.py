"""Scenarios of ``mpc_scen`` and ``hindsight_consensus``: G_pub(. | observations to t) as built (M4, "lp-baselines").

Design (70), §8.2; Q17, Q100 (1).

The owner's rule "residual durations" (Q100 (1), 2026-09-27), as the design §12 M4 row "Scenario draws" records it and
the stream's rows "Scenario windows as built", "Inferred types and residual keys as built", "Residual life as built"
and "Scenario library as built" refine it:

- **A scenario** is the observed present plus future onsets. Each impairment observed at the instant t - 1 (a
  chokepoint's open fraction below 1, an edge's capacity below u^0, a prohibition, a tariff, a war-risk class, a fab's
  or OSAT's R below 1, a grid's G-bar below nominal, a supply cap below nominal, a freight rate above c^0) ends after a
  residual duration drawn each week from the published duration law of its inferred event type, conditioned on its
  observed age a (the owner's "Condition on age", Q100 (1)): S(a + r) / S(a), S the type's survival function, where the
  start was seen (the element shown nominal the week before it was first shown impaired); the equilibrium
  (length-biased) residual life (density S(r) / E[T]), conditioned the same way on the weeks observed since, where it
  was not (carried in at week 1, or first seen after a blackout or a masked week). ``ImpairmentAges`` books the ages;
  the future onsets are the events of one public-generator draw with onset > t - 1. Pending prohibitions
  (``obs["pending_prohibitions"]``) switch on from their effective week in every scenario, as in
  ``lp_common.persistence_arrays``, so the pair mpc_scen > mpc_det differs by the scenarios only. Demand is the point
  forecast of ``lp_common.persistence_arrays`` in every scenario. §8.2's "regime-conditioned" is read as conditioning on
  the observed present only: warnings and messages are not used, and the future onsets come from the public generator's
  own regime path (G_pub's draw of episode 0), not conditioned on the observed regime.
- **The window's marks** (design §12 "Scenario windows as built"): no event type can carry most present impairments
  alone without touching elements observed nominal (no event cuts one edge or restores one fab), so a window composes
  two layers as ``marks.py`` composes events (Q50): the *future layer* is ``marks.compute_marks`` of the draw's events
  with onset > t - 1 on a synthetic omega, never re-coded; the *present layer* holds each observed element at its
  observed severity over [t - 1, t - 1 + r) by (37)'s overlap rule (``marks.open_fraction``) for week averages and by
  (1)'s in-force rule for binary marks. Capacities multiply, tariffs add, prohibitions unite, classes take the larger;
  sigma^scr and the fab hits come from the future layer only (observed WIP is net of the present's scrap).
- **The inferred type** of an observed impairment (design §12 "Inferred types and residual keys as built"): a
  chokepoint closure is a militarised closure when its war-risk class is not none, else a weather closure; a war-risk
  class is the militarised closure of c when c is observed impaired or the class is red_sea (class 1, which only a
  closure sets), else (class 2 with c open) a regional conflict in a region adjacent to c; a prohibition is a
  sanction; a tariff a tariff; an edge capacity loss a port strike, under the generator's strike duration law as drawn
  (stoppage with probability ``stoppage_share``, else slowdown: the observed severity is pro-rated within a week and
  does not tell them apart); a fab or OSAT restoration a regional conflict; a G-bar loss an energy shock; a supply cap
  below nominal (varsigma-bar 0) a material outage; a freight surcharge (c above c^0) piracy.
- **The public generator** is the split's public profile and rung named in the policy config (``GeneratorRef``;
  the anchor rung of the instance's profile on an injected list); nothing comes from omega or Static.
- **Entropy**: public keyed streams, like naive's stream 22, never E_split and never the policy seed. Stream 23's keys
  lead with a form code, as stream 1's do (design §4.1 table): scenario i's generator run takes the 128-bit entropy of
  key (``FORM_ENTROPY``, instance kind, rung index, baseline tag, i) on the public root 0, episode component 0, and
  samples episode 0; the residual uniforms come from key (``FORM_RESIDUAL``, instance kind, rung index, baseline tag,
  i, week, impairment code, element), the week coded as calendar week + B_burn (§4.1, Q87). So the scenario library
  is a function of (instance, generator, baseline, count): the same draws in every episode (common random numbers
  across episodes), drawn once per process and cached like naive's F_Q (0.4-1.3 s per draw on `tiny`), and an
  omega-hat is never omega (whose generator run takes E_split itself).
- **Stream 20** (the (70) tie-break weights): one (T, nc) array of uniforms on [0, 1) per instance, on the public
  root 0, episode 0, key (instance kind,); a rolled window takes the calendar weeks t..t + H - 1, so a column keeps its
  weight across re-solves. The key lies in any dev split's keyspace at E_split = 0 (n = 0, stream 20), harmless since
  omega never draws stream 20; a V2 draw audit covers omega sampling only.
