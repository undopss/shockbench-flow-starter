"""The hackathon kit's own agents as registry policies: the M5 pilot's participant-like entries.

The leaderboard's split sizes come from the variance of entries like a participant's, which the §2.6 pairs understate
by about 20× on `tiny` (docs/099-split-variance.md, "What the M5 pilot must record", item 4), so the pilot plays the
kit's two samples on the same episodes as the baselines (owner, 2026-09-29):

- ``sample_random``: ``docs/hackathon/samples/random`` (uniform random flows, override quantities and release modes,
  from ``config["policy_seed"]``);
- ``sample_heuristic``: ``docs/hackathon/samples/heuristic`` (the cover heuristic, the Codabench starting kit's agent).

The M5 gate's pilots also played ``send_max`` (flows = capacity x ``action_mask``; from ``examples/send_max_agent.py``,
then, from the M5 re-gate, from the Codabench bundle's baseline solution under ``deploy/``). The re-gate follow-up
dropped it from the pilot (the owner, 2026-09-29, "Drop it from the pilot"): it stays solely the bundle's baseline
submission, so the package reads nothing under ``deploy/``, and the committed pilot summaries keep its runs.

Every kit agent passes the kit's own container check (``shockbench_flow_agent.submission.agent_warnings``, what
``sbf-validate`` prints) and imports with only the policy image's packages (tests/test_kit_agents.py).

``KitAgentPolicy`` plays the agent in process behind the policy container's shim (``shockbench_flow_agent.AgentShim``:
the flat layout, ``Agent(config)``, the Dict observation, the Dict action to the wire action, a failed week's null
action), so an episode is the one ``shockbench_flow_agent.evaluate`` plays in process, week for week. Its policy seed is
the trusted runner's for that agent's submission (``hosting.trusted``: (27) salted by the submission's SHA-256): the
policy declares ``seed_id``, the SHA-256 of the zip the starter kit builds from its source
(``hosting.submission.build_submission``, the sample's ``README.md`` left out as ``scripts/python/build_starter_kit.py``
leaves it; a single file is zipped as ``agent.py``), and the runner salts the seed with it
(``evaluation.runner.episode_policy_seed``). So on the same episode, root and split, its J equals ``evaluate``'s on
that zip in process, to the cent (tests/test_kit_agents.py). Since the seed and every trajectory of an agent that
draws follow from the files' bytes, the policy also declares ``provenance`` (its source, ``seed_id`` and the SHA-256
of each file of the zip), which the runner records in ``EvalResult.setup["policy_provenance"]``, so a summary names
the bytes its kit rows were played with (M5 re-gate DET-M5R-2).

A ``KitAgentPolicy`` pickles by name and checkout (``__reduce__``): the ``Agent`` class lives under a module name
only the importing process has (``sbf_kit_<name>``), so a subprocess child (``information.runner.child_argv``, the
M3 wire's subprocess transport) rebuilds the policy from the checkout's files instead of failing to unpickle it
(M5 re-gate INT-M5R-01). A policy is pickled between episodes: an unpickled one is the fresh policy, whose ``reset``
builds its agent, as every ``reset`` does.

The agents are the organisers' own code, played in the trusted process like a baseline; a participant's submission is
never played this way (the hidden split scores it through the policy container only, §9.4). They take no parameters and
read no ``PolicyContext`` (a participant sees Static and the observations alone). Their sources are repository files,
never package data: they resolve against the checkout that holds the working directory (``checkout_root``: the first
directory from the working directory up holding ``.project-root``, the anchor the scripts find with ``rootutils``), so
the entry points and the tests run from the checkout, and the joblib workers inherit it. ``shockbench_flow_agent`` is
imported inside the functions only, so the package's module-level imports stay the simulator's.
