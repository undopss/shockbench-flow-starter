"""The generator: one omega of the public generator G_pub for (instance, params, E_split, episode) (design §4).

``sample_events`` runs the subsystems in order (regime layers and latent risk, the cluster sampler over burn-in and
episode, event typing and marks, the unexcited Poisson components, then the dyad strait closures that marked regional
conflicts derive on `small` and `full`, ``events.strait_closures``, M5); ``sample_omega`` assembles the schema-1
container (§4.1 table) with demand (21) on the regime path, the stored marks, and empty shadow, opponent and blackout
groups (filled by milestone M3 and phase 4). Every draw is keyed (27), so the same (E_split, n, params) gives the same
omega in every process, and a lower rung's events are a subset of a higher rung's with identical marks (V2).
``sample_closures`` draws only what naive's F_Q (66) reads: the militarised and weather closures ``sample_events``
would store, less the strait closures, which naive's transient F_Q leaves out (M5-O13 default).
An ``EventSample`` records the draw it comes from (E_split, n and the generator id of (params, instance)), and
``sample_omega`` refuses to assemble a reused sample under any other (DET-M2-5): omega is a function of (E_split, n,
params) and its meta fields name them (§4.1). The three entry points run under the fixed floating-point error state
``marks.FP_ERRORS`` (``marks.fixed_fp_errors``, §12 'Floating-point error state'), whatever the caller's NumPy error
state, so every subsystem they call sees one state (SIMP-M2R2-11).
