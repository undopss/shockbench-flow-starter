"""`human_ref`: Sterman's anchoring-and-adjustment ordering rule at its fitted means (M4, stream "heuristics").

Design §8.2 table; Sterman 1989; Q100 (3).

Per destination (j, k) of naive's plan, each week:

    L-hat_t = theta L_{t-1} + (1 - theta) L-hat_{t-1},    O = max(0, L-hat_t + alpha_S (S'_jk - S - beta SL))

with S = on-hand - backlog, SL = pipeline plus queued lots bound for j, and L the observed demand at a sink
(``last_week.sinks.demand``; d-bar m^sea(1) in week 1) and naive's route demand sum_l d_lk m^sea(t) elsewhere.
Readings (design §12 M4 rows "human_ref" and "`human_ref` as built"):

- S'_jk = sum_l d_lk (``desired_weeks(params)`` + beta tau_l): Sterman's desired stock S' = 17 cases over the beer
  game's flow of 4 cases a week and supply line of 16 cases, (S' - beta x 16) / 4 = (17 - 0.34 x 16) / 4 = 2.89 weeks
  of cover at the fitted means (``DESIRED_WEEKS``) plus beta x the route's transit (the alternative S'_jk = 4.25 d_jk
  would sit routes with tau >= 13 at negative equilibrium stock); the mapping is a new number, SYNTHETIC(placeholder),
  so V23 blocks sealing on it; ``s_prime`` and ``beta`` of ``HumanRefParams`` feed it; fixed at reset from d_lk at
  m^sea = 1, without naive's I-bar_g or offset (the target is Sterman's, not naive's);
- L-hat starts at the first observation (the first ``act`` after a reset sets L-hat_t = L_{t-1}, Sterman's equilibrium
  start), then follows the update above; L_{t-1} at a sink is the realised demand d^{t-1} of ``last_week.sinks``
  (served or not), d-bar m^sea(t) when ``last_week`` is None (week 1);
- the order is split over naive's routes in proportion to d_lk with naive's route choice (steps 5-6), through
  ``naive_action(..., targets=IP + O)``, then the end-aware cut (71)-(72), so human_ref differs from the anchor by its
  ordering rule alone; a slot whose own edge is prohibited is never sent (naive's rule, Q111). human_ref sums IP in
  naive's exact order (step 4 of ``naive_action``: 0.0 plus the stock entries of (j, k) in observation order, then
  ``+= sum`` of the pipeline list bound for j, then ``+= sum`` of the queued lots bound for j, then ``-=`` the summed
  backlog), so naive orders
  max(0, (IP + O) - IP): exactly 0 when O = 0, and O up to the rounding of IP + O (a few ulps of max(IP, O)) otherwise;
- L-hat is reset at every ``reset`` (V1: an object reused over two episodes gives the fresh object's trajectories);
- L-hat is the rule's only cross-week state, so ``state()`` returns it as plain data and ``load_state`` restores it
  after a reset of the same episode: an in-process resume (B2) continues bit for bit, as the LP baselines' does (design
  §12 "Warm start (M4 reading)"; DET-M4-1: without it a restore re-seeded L-hat from the first observed demand, which a
  blackout hides). A wire resume (a fresh Reset at week t) starts L-hat afresh, documented, not asserted equal.
