"""The weekly simulator in the order of design §3.2 (V4), on one instance and one ``WeeklyMarks``.

Steps of week t: 3 forward at chokepoints (§3.4 pseudocode: arrivals join the lot book; overrides first; default release
by arrival cohort, FIFO across cohorts, pro rata inside a cohort (10); fleet slack last), 4 clip of the requests (3)-(7)
(mask, joint edge cap, shared stock pro rata over the lane sub-requests of each (edge, commodity), fleet slack per pool
over every release that matches a term of ``Instance.dup_items``, chokepoint releases included: an edge-level sea
duplicate or turn-back counts all its flow, a lane term the flow dispatched on its lane), 5 dispatch (2),
6 arrive, 7 produce (supply lift refilling to the cap (Q79); grid segments with gas rationing on fuel on hand (15)-(18)
under pri_g; fab lots (12) with gross WIP; scrap booked in onset weeks (14); OSAT packaging (19) up to
thr_i R_osat_i(t), the OSAT restoration of (13) under a regional conflict (§4.4)), 8 serve (20),
9 charge (disposal above I^max at non-chokepoint, non-supply nodes; C_t (23) and C^¢_t (24)). Step 10 reads the next
week's marks; no random draw happens anywhere.

Floating-point order: the design's reference code ``scripts/python/evidence/tiny_fixture.py`` (class ``Sim``) fixes the
operation order that reproduces the frozen integer cents of §2.4; this module follows it: dispatch draws each executed
slot from its stock in slot order; shipments are appended to the pipeline as dispatches (slot order) then chokepoint
releases (release order), and arrivals are added one shipment at a time in pipeline order; each lane queue Q_ckl is
recomputed from its lots in book order and the chokepoint stock is their fsum over lanes (``cost.queue_totals``, the
LP's formation, §12 'Cost terms (23)'); supply lifts, grids, fabs and OSATs run in instance order; the rationing
factor reads I^{t-1}, the available gas is ``min((zeta G-bar) ration, fuel on hand after steps 5-6)``, the segment
load factor is ``(sum E + y) / G-av``; holding is charged on end-of-week stock after disposal.

Rules the design leaves open, with the reading chosen here (conservative; design §12 'Phase-3 implementation notes'):

- Stock clamps (Q58 M11): a stock that a dispatch, a grid burn or packaging leaves in [-band, 0) is set to 0 and
  logged in ``StepRecord.clamps`` as (slot, value), with band = 1e-12 max(A-bar, |q|, draw, smallest normal float),
  q the quantity taken; A-bar is what bounded it (I^{t-1} for a dispatch, the segment's G^av for a burn, the raw stock
  for packaging) and the draw what the factor that scaled it was computed from (a dispatch's request capped at u'_e,
  the grid's requested load y-bar + sum E-hat of (18) for a burn, the OSAT throughput thr R_osat for packaging). With
  a subnormal A-bar that factor ((5), the served share of (18), (19)) is subnormal and errs by up to 2^-1075
  absolutely, so the draw, not A-bar, bounds the excess; below the smallest normal float every operation errs by up to
  2^-1074. Anything more negative is a bug and raises ``RuntimeError``; a valid action never does (M1 pre-gate
  ORACLE-PRE-1, INT-1, DET-1).
- Edge clamps (Q95): on an edge whose factor (4) is subnormal, the clip takes the executed requests from u'_e in slot
  order under the same rule (``clip.edge_clamp``): a residual left in [-band, 0), with band = 1e-12 max(u'_e, |x|, q,
  smallest normal float) and q the slot's request, lowers that slot to the residual before it and is logged in
  ``StepRecord.edge_clamps`` as (action slot, value); the subnormal factor errs by up to q 2^-1075, which the band
  bounds. The override step at chokepoints applies the same rule to the override slots on an out-edge whose factor (4)
  is subnormal, before (6) (``chokepoint._overrides``), and logs it apart, in ``StepRecord.override_clamps`` as
  (override slot, value), q the override request. Anything lower raises ``RuntimeError``. A week without an edge clamp
  is unchanged bit for bit, and so is its record's hash.
- Dust lots: every week, after the releases, every queue lot with 0 < qty <= 1e-12 leaves the book, whether or not
  anything was released from it (a held lot, a lot on a prohibited next edge or one that arrived this week alike), as
  the reference does (``tiny_fixture.py`` filters the whole book), and is logged in ``clamps`` with its (positive)
  quantity.
- Scrap (14) is booked for every hit in ``marks.fab_hits`` whose onset week is t, on the gross WIP of start weeks
  [t - w_scr, t - 1] (initial WIP included), before this week's output matures, so (12) holds with the same totals.
  Whether a carried-in event (onset <= 0) is a fab hit is the marks module's decision, not the simulator's.
- A hold and override slots on the same (c, k) in one week: the hold wins (nothing is released).
- Supply lift is ``max(0, min(avail, I^max - stock))``; the guard only matters if a supply node ever receives
  shipments.
- The rationing factor min{1, I^{t-1} / (psi I-bar_g)} of (15), (18) is 1 whenever I^{t-1} >= psi I-bar_g, else
  I^{t-1} / (psi I-bar_g): the LP's row psi I-bar_g G <= zeta G-bar I^{t-1} read as a factor, so psi I-bar_g = 0 (0/0
  included) does not ration, and for psi I-bar_g > 0 the float is the reference's ``min`` (M1 pre-gate DC-1).
