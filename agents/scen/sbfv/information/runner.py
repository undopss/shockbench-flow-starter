"""The local runner: one episode over the §9.2 wire, and the policy side that answers it (design §9.2-9.4; Q71).

``play_wire_episode`` drives an ``Env`` through a ``Transport``: reset, the Reset line (no reply), then for each week
t = 1..T drain and discard the pipe, send Request(t) with the episode's one nonce (Q86: one episode tag and one nonce
per (submission, episode)), read until a reply, a failure or the deadline (discarding stale lines, those whose action
names an earlier week, Q71 X5), and step the Env with the reply's action, or with ``Env.step(None,
wire_failure=<code>)`` on a whole-week wire failure (``wire.WIRE_FAILURES``). After a kill no Request is sent and every
remaining week steps with ``wire_failure='killed'`` (naive plays the rest, §9.3). Its trajectory equals the in-process
``dynamics.env.rollout`` of the same policy bit for bit (the wire moves nothing). The cgroup freeze, CPU metering and
the overage bank are M6 (§9.4): locally ``remaining_bank`` is sent from the limits and never metered; the hosted
runner of Q113 passes a ``WeekMeter`` (``hosting.metering.WeekCpu``), whose week over its CPU budget steps with
``wire_failure='cpu'``, and may end a week early through ``SubprocessTransport.interrupt``. With
``hide_regime`` the runner sends ``Static.regime`` null (several regimes scored in one run; design §12 M3 rows). Its
settings (the transport, ``WireLimits``, the deadline, ``hide_regime``) are read by
``scripts/python/run_wire_episode.py`` alone; ``run_episode.py`` refuses them.

``serve`` is the policy side, which a child process runs under ``sys.executable -c`` (``child_argv``, the policy's
pickle handed over a private temporary file; ``serve_stdio``): it loops ``serve_line`` over the lines it reads, and
``LoopbackTransport`` calls ``serve_line`` once per line sent, so both answer a line by one rule. Both reset the policy
by ``policies.base.reset_policy`` (the keyword ``omega`` exactly when ``wants_omega``), as ``rollout`` does.

Readings of design §12 (M3 wire rows):

- Week read loop: the lines drained before Request(t), and those completed while it is written, are discarded and
  counted stale for week t (counted, never stored); after Request(t) the first line that is not stale decides the
  week; the deadline is one per week, measured from the send of Request(t), so stale lines never extend it.
- Closed channel: a ``Receipt`` of kind 'closed' makes that week and every later week 'killed', with no line sent
  after it (the transport is killed).
- Subprocess transport: non-blocking reads through a selector, a line buffered to at most ``max_reply_bytes`` + 1
  bytes (an overlong line returned as those bytes, its remainder discarded up to its newline); at a deadline a partial
  line is discarded the same way; a send not written within the deadline kills the child; the first line (the
  Reset) is written, and read by the child, within the start-up budget ``startup_s`` instead: the transport holds the
  read end of the child's stdin until the pipe is empty (FIONREAD), so the child's start-up counts against no week,
  whatever the Reset's size.
- Loopback transport: in process, synchronous; an exception of the policy propagates, as in ``rollout``.
- Resume: a Reset with fresh tokens carrying the restored week's observation and the reset info that the caller kept
  beside the snapshot, then Requests to T (the runner reads nothing private of the Env).

    the child's start-up (the interpreter, its imports, the policy's unpickling and its read of that line), and every
    later line is written within ``deadline_s``, so the start-up is charged to no week (M3 attempt 1's gate, DET-M3-2;
    the policy's own reset work after it has read the Reset still counts against week 1, since the Reset gets no
    reply). The child's read is seen on the pipe itself: the transport keeps its own copy of the read end of the
    child's stdin until the first line is read, and ``send`` returns once no byte of it is left unread (FIONREAD on
    that end, Linux and macOS alike), so the allowance does not depend on the line's size (the wire skeptic of M3's
    gate-1 fixes: a Reset that fit in the OS pipe buffer was written at once, and the child's start-up counted against
    week 1 again). A child that has not read the whole first line by then is killed, as is one that stops reading its
    stdin later; one that exits or closes its stdout first is a closed channel. Every ``receive`` after a
    ``send`` waits until that send's deadline (so stale lines never extend a week); reads are non-blocking through a
    selector and a line is buffered to at most ``max_reply_bytes`` + 1 bytes: an overlong line is returned as those
    bytes, without a newline, and its remainder discarded up to its newline; at a deadline a partial line is discarded
    the same way, whenever its newline comes, so its bytes never prefix a later line; a send not written by its
    deadline (a child that stops reading its stdin) kills the child. The lines read by ``drain`` or while a send is
    blocked (read so that a child writing while it reads never deadlocks) are counted and discarded, never queued, so
    a flooding child cannot grow the runner's memory; only ``receive`` queues lines, one read at a time. ``peak`` is
    the largest line buffer held (design §12 "Subprocess transport (M3 wire)"; threats row 19).

    ``interrupt`` (None by default: nothing changes) is the hosted runner's hook (Q113): while ``receive`` waits for a
    reply it is called every ``interrupt_poll_s`` seconds, and True ends the wait as the deadline does (a partial line
    abandoned), so a week whose CPU went over its budget ends at once instead of at the wall-clock deadline. Lines
    already read are returned first; the start-up's ready line is read before the runner sets it.
