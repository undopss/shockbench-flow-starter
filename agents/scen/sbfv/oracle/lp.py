"""The time-expanded oracle LP (51)-(52) and its solve with SciPy's HiGHS (design §6.1, §6.3; Q1, Q58, Q73).

The LP is the simulator's equations with the clip, the default container release, the energy priority rule and the
allocation (18) replaced by the feasible sets they project onto, in the simulator's order (§6.1), built from the same
instance and the same ``WeeklyMarks`` (V3). No cap row at any chokepoint (Q58 M4); queued cargo of commodities without
override is lane-indexed (52) (containers; nucfuel would be too), tanker cargo K^ov is aggregated per (c, k) since
overrides make its release free (Q34, Q68), and is released on the out-edges that carry an override slot for (c, k).
Terminal credit and salvage as in (23) (Q93): a flow column still in transit at T credits the nu of its edge's head,
a queue column at T its chokepoint's nu, and an initial shipment still out at T its head's nu, as a constant. Rows are
stored with names so the replay test (53) can report the worst one.
The builder, the solve and the cost helpers run under the fixed NumPy error state ``marks.FP_ERRORS``, never the
caller's (DET-P3-2).
Costs are formed as the simulator forms them (§12, oracle cents), so J_LP^¢(z^pi) = J^pi¢ for every trajectory, not
only within (53): flow terms per (edge, commodity) on x_ek = ``cost.edge_flows`` of the week's lane columns; queue
holding per (chokepoint, commodity) on I_ck = ``cost.queue_totals`` of its lane columns; the WIP credit of a start
still out at T as nu times its net WIP, the start times each (1 - sigma_q) of its hits in the simulator's order
(``scrap_factors``), and initial WIP entries of one (fab, out week) or (OSAT, commodity, out week) added first; the
in-transit credit per (edge, commodity, week) as nu_head x_ek and the queue credit as nu_ck I_ck, on the same lane sums.

Variable keys (tuples, week t first after the tag):
  ("x", t, e, k, lane)       executed flow; lane set for dispatches into a chokepoint and for releases of
                             lane-indexed cargo out of one, None otherwise (tanker releases aggregate over lanes)
  ("I", t, slot)             end-of-week stock of a non-chokepoint slot
  ("Q", t, c, k, lane)       end-of-week queue at chokepoint node c (lane None for K^ov cargo)
  ("O", t, slot)             disposal at non-chokepoint, non-supply slots
  ("lift", t, slot)          supply lift at supply slots, 0 <= lift <= varsigma-bar^t
  ("p", t, f)                lots started (fab ordinal)
  ("xi", t, o, k)            OSAT starts (osat ordinal, packaged k)
  ("G", t, g, k)             segment output (grid ordinal, fuel k or None)
  ("E", t, f)                energy to fab f (fabs with a grid)
  ("y", t, g), ("ysh", t, g) served and shed base load
  ("D", t, d), ("U", t, d), ("B", t, d)   served, lost, backlog per demand ordinal (U only at lost-sales sinks,
                             B only at backlog sinks)

Row names (week t second), in the simulator's order of §3.2 within each week. Equalities: ("queue", t, c, k, lane)
(52), ("balance", t, slot) (8), ("baseload", t, g) (17), ("demand", t, d) or ("backlog", t, d) (20). Rows <=:
("edge_cap", t, e) (4) where an edge has more than one variable (otherwise the cap is the variable's bound),
("dispatch", t, slot) (5), ("throughput", t, c, pool) (9), ("fleet", t, pool) (7) over the terms of E^dup
(``Instance.dup_items``: every flow on an edge-level duplicate or turn-back, a lane term's flows on its entry edge),
("fab_energy", t, f) (12), ("ration", t, g) (15), ("energy", t, g) (17), ("osat", t, o) (19) for OSATs with several
products (one product: a bound), its right-hand side thr_i R_osat_i(t) under an OSAT restoration (13) (§4.4), and
("serve", t, d) (20) at backlog sinks.

Planning rules (``build_lp(..., planning_rules=True)``; design §12 M5 row "Planning rules", owner queue M5-O19 (b)).
The window LPs of ``mpc_det`` and ``mpc_scen`` add the simulator's rules that (51) leaves free (§6.1 "Remaining
relaxation"): a proportional split as rows, a priority as a price on the column the rule empties (the prices are in
``meta["priority"]``, which ``LPModel.objective`` adds; they never enter (23)'s components, ``lp_costs``, ``lp_cents``
or a replay). The oracle and every other caller keep the switch off, and the model is then byte-identical to the one
without it, so J^oracle stays a bound (V5) and the two share one row table (V3). With the switch on:
  ("lam", t, g)              the grid's load factor in [0, 1] (18)
  ("short", t, g, k)         a fuel segment's shortfall below its share of the load, charged v_k (18)
  ("rho", t, g)              the ratio of its feasible lots a grid's fabs start (12), (18)
  rows ("load", t, g, None): G_g0 = lam zeta_g0 G-bar; ("load_hi", t, g, k): G_gk <= lam zeta_gk G-bar; ("load_lo",
  t, g, k): lam zeta_gk G-bar - short_gk <= G_gk (every week); ("lot_start", t, f): p_f = rho_g p-hat_f, or
  p_f = p-hat_f at a fab without a grid or energy, p-hat_f = min(alpha-bar R cap0, wafers on hand after steps 5-6), the
  first week only; ("osat_start", t, o, k): xi_ok at (19)'s rule on the raw stock, the first week only
  prices: ysh_g in the first week at base_first grids with a fab that draws energy (base load first), V / min e_f over
  the grid's fabs, V the largest pi_d (times the horizon at a backlog sink) or nu of the instance; a fab's wafer stock
  and disposal, v_wafer; an OSAT's raw-chip stock and disposal, v_k; a lane-indexed queue in the weeks its pool's
  throughput is open, v_k (10).
