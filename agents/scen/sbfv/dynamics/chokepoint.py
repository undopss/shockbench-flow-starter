"""The chokepoint lot book and its weekly release, design §3.4 pseudocode steps 1-3, (9)-(10) (Q4, Q25, Q34, Q68, Q86).

Step 1: shipments arriving at a chokepoint in week t become lots under the lot id they received at dispatch (in
action-slot order, then release order for tandem-lane releases; initial shipments at reset in pipeline order).

Step 2, overrides first (tanker cargo K^ov only): any override slot or hold for (c, k) turns the default release of k at
c off this week. A hold releases nothing; when a hold and override slots name the same (c, k), the hold wins. Override
quantities pass (3) (K_e and Z_t), (4) the out-edge capacity per edge over its override slots, (5) the queue content of
k at c and (6) the pool's throughput kappa_cb, each factor pro rata across the override slots it covers. On an out-edge
whose float factor (4) is subnormal, the override slots then pass the edge clamp of the dispatch clip in slot order,
before (6) (``clip.edge_clamp``, Q95): a residual of u'_e left in [-b, 0), with b = 1e-12 max(u'_e, |x|, q, smallest
normal float) and q the slot's override request, lowers that slot to the residual before it and is logged as
(override slot, value) (``StepRecord.override_clamps``); anything lower raises ``RuntimeError``. Units are then taken
FIFO within k by (arrival_week, dispatch_week, entry_edge, lane, lot_id); the taken part ships with the slot's lane
(None on a turn-back on no lane) and the remainder of a split lot keeps its id and its place in the book.

Step 3, the default release (10) on the residual kappa'_cb and u'_e: arrival cohorts in increasing order and, inside a
cohort, the pools (tb, ct); a lot whose next edge is prohibited for its commodity releases nothing; next-edge capacity
pro rata inside the cohort, then throughput pro rata inside the cohort. The arithmetic follows the design's reference
code (``tiny_fixture.py``, ``Sim.step`` step 3) exactly, including its residual updates ``u' -= X`` per released lot and
``kappa' -= eta_kappa * total``, so the package reproduces its cents.

Releases returned here are tentative: the simulator applies the fleet slack (7) last, jointly with the week's duplicate
dispatches, and only then takes the released quantities out of the lots; the unreleased share stays in the lot it came
from, which keeps its key (§3.4 step 4).
