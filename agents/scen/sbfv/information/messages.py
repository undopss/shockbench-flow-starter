"""Announcements, their threads and the §9.2 messages and pending_prohibitions fields (design §5.1, §5.3; (1), (49)).

Trusted side: every real announcement comes from omega's ``ev_lead`` (the lead per channel of each stored event, NaN
where the event is not announced there) and every shadow one from the ``sh_*`` group, which the decoy stream fills
(``disruption.announce``); ``decoys.shown_mask`` thins the shadows by (49). A *thread* is one event's announcements:
a tariff's proposal (formal or informal) and final notice, a sanction's TIES threat and legal publication, a
militarised closure's MID threat (symmetric channel sets, Q97, frozen in ``omega.codes.TYPE_CHANNELS``), plus a shown
shadow's withdrawal at its effect time. Readings of design §12 (M3 rows):

- The instant of an announcement is a = t_on - l (weeks); it is shown from week w(a) = ceil(a) + 1, that is at every
  instant t - 1 >= a (1). A shadow's withdrawal has the instant t_j, its shadow effect time. A real event is never
  withdrawn, and a shadow announcement with lead <= 0 is never shown (49).
- ``msg_id`` is the thread's rank by its first shown announcement instant, over the real and the shown shadow threads
  alike, ties broken by public fields only (channel, region, target kind, target, k): never by row, source or key,
  and never over unshown shadows (gaps would reveal the thinning). Every message of a thread, its withdrawal included,
  carries its msg_id; ids shown at week t never depend on later messages.
- ``messages`` is cumulative: every shown message with instant <= t - 1, from the episode start; an announcement made
  in a blackout spell is shown after the spell. Threads whose effect instant is < 0 are not shown (no pre-episode
  history, §11 row 47). ``stated_effective_week`` is w(t_on) for proposals, final notices and publications, null for
  TIES and MID threats, which state no date. No rate field (the signed-off schema has none).
- A tariff's final notice never comes before its proposal (Q12.3's order, a proposal then a final notice): its lead
  is min(its own draw, the proposal's lead), real and shadow alike (``disruption.announce``); a sanction thread's two
  leads are independent draws.
- ``pending_prohibitions`` lists the (edge, k) pairs of every shown ``sanction_legal`` publication (the sanction's
  final notice) announced by t - 1 whose effective week w(t_on) > t, from the thread's own event row by the marks rule
  for that event alone (``marks.graph_marks`` of one event, V3) less the instance's ``prohibitions_at_reset`` (Z_0,
  which ``graph_marks`` includes); ``pending_at`` takes every shown message and keeps the legal publications itself,
  nothing from a TIES threat or a tariff, and nothing read from ``ev_*`` directly, so a pending entry never tells a
  real thread from a decoy. Clairvoyant's exact list is ``view.clairvoyant_pending``, not this.

``announced_week`` of an announcement made before the instant 0 (a < 0, effect in [0, T)) is w(a) unclipped, real and
shadow alike (<= 0 for a <= -1).
