"""The V22 realism band and its reported items on generated omegas (design §4.4, §2.4, §2.6, §10 V22).

Sources: §4.4 "Realism band", the §2.4 `tiny` profile row, §2.6 "The realism band ... holds on every rung"; Q39, Q40,
Q52, Q68, Q94. The band, per rung (§4.4 table, SYNTHETIC(prior: the W2-maritime §2.2 record, counted in F5 §4.2)):
militarised closures per year at the anchor rung in [0.073, 0.43]; the mean number of chokepoints cut to <= 60 % at the
anchor rung in [0.15, 0.73]; closures per year at the stress rungs <= 3 x 0.85; every chokepoint's mean open fraction
>= 0.5 at every rung. On `tiny` (§2.4 profile row; Q94 (a), (d)) it is the §4.4 band scaled by 4/7, since `chk` stands
for four of the seven flagship chokepoints: closures per year at the anchor in [0.042, 0.246], mean impaired
chokepoints in [0.086, 0.417], and the open-fraction item read per constituent (Q94 (a)): o_chk^(1/4) >= 0.5, i.e. the
mean open fraction o_chk >= 0.5^4 = 0.0625 (``RealismBand.constituents``, 4 for `chk`; the flagship band keeps 1 per
chokepoint). No stress ceiling on `tiny` (Q94 (d)), so ``TINY_BAND`` has none; ``stress_ceiling`` reports the
stationary closure rates of (32) beside the ceiling scaled by 4/7 (3 x 0.85 x 4/7 = 1.457) and unscaled (2.55).

Reported, not gated (V22): harm (41)-(42) per episode (and (43) per type); the share of target-weeks where (37)
combines two or more events; tanker overrides that starve containers of throughput (§3.4, Q68).

Readings where the design leaves the rule open (fixed here, reported for design rows):

- **Closures per year**, two estimators of one stationary rate: the published one counts the militarised closures of
  omega's event list with onset in [0, T), per T / 52 years; the record one counts the militarised closures of the
  episode's whole generated process (``sampler.EventSample.marked``, burn-in included) with onset in
  [``record_start``, T), where ``record_start`` = min(-B_burn + 3 t95, 0) and t95 is (33): the regime layers and X
  start at their stationary laws (§4.3), so onsets are stationary once the Hawkes mean intensity has relaxed (its gap
  is then 0.05^3 of the stationary rate). On `tiny` at the anchor the record holds about 50 times the information of
  the episode's 26 weeks, so the band test reads it; the published estimator is reported beside it.
- **Impaired chokepoints**: per week, the number of chokepoints whose week-average open fraction o^t_c of (37)
  (``marks.compute_marks``) is <= the impairment cut 0.6 (§8.1 step 6, SYNTHETIC, §11 row 83), averaged over the weeks
  1..T. o^t_c includes weather and accident closures, which (37) combines with the militarised ones.
- **Open fraction**: per chokepoint, the mean of o^t_c over the weeks 1..T.
- **Independence**: episodes are independent draws (distinct episode indices n of (27)), so each item is a mean over
  episodes with the standard error of the per-episode values.
- **Band test** (burden of proof on failing, Q94 (b)): an item fails when a one-sided t test at level ``alpha`` (default
  0.001, the V9 and V12 level) rejects "the generator's value lies in the band" at the violated edge,
  (mean - hi) / SE > t_{1-alpha, n-1} or (lo - mean) / SE > t_{1-alpha, n-1}. A point-estimate reading would fail
  about half of all seeds on `tiny`, whose anchor calibration, 0.43 x 4/7 closures per year (§2.4), is the band's
  upper edge. Each chokepoint's open fraction is tested at alpha / C (Bonferroni over the C chokepoints). A chokepoint
  standing for k constituents is tested on the aggregate scale against floor^k: o^(1/k) >= floor and o >= floor^k are
  one event, since x -> x^(1/k) increases; ``BandCheck.per_constituent`` reports o^(1/k) beside it, with the
  delta-method SE.
- **Stated power** (Q94 (b)): each gated item at each rung carries power ``POWER`` = 0.8 against a stated alternative
  past its violated edge, and that power sets its episode count (``band_episodes``; a rung runs the largest count of
  its items). The alternatives: an open fraction ``OPEN_FRACTION_DISTANCE`` = 0.1 per constituent below the floor, i.e.
  the aggregate (floor - 0.1)^k (0.4^4 = 0.0256 on `chk` against 0.0625), at alpha / C (the owner queue's example for
  option (b) 1, 2026-09-26); closures per year ``CLOSURES_DISTANCE`` = 50 % above the upper edge (the anchor band, and
  the stress ceiling where the band has one); impaired chokepoints ``IMPAIRED_DISTANCE`` = 0.25 above the upper edge.
  The design states all three (Q94 (b); §10 "V22, band", §11 row 86): on `tiny` the alternatives are 0.3686
  closures per year and 0.6671 impaired chokepoints, the closure and impaired distances SYNTHETIC there (the M2
  build's earlier post-hoc power statements), the open-fraction distance the owner queue's example. The power is that
  of ``check_item`` itself. The per-episode SD at the alternative: for a bounded item (an open fraction in
  [0, 1], the impaired count in [0, C]) the largest SD any law of that mean can have on that range, sqrt((b - m)(m - a))
  of the two-point law on {a, b} (Bhatia-Davis); for the closure rate, unbounded, a pilot dispersion kappa = SD /
  sqrt(rate) from the caller's pilot on another entropy, times the root of the alternative rate (the SD scaled as the
  root of the rate, as for counts at fixed clustering). The power is the noncentral t's (``band_power``, exact for
  normal per-episode values); for a bounded item also the exact power under that two-point law (``two_point_power``,
  whose sample mean is far from normal near an end of the range), and the smaller of the two is stated. The count is
  the smallest n >= 2 whose stated power reaches ``POWER`` (``episodes_for_power``). The lower edges carry no stated
  power: the stated alternatives lie past the upper edges, where `tiny`'s anchor calibration sits (§2.4).
- **Target-weeks of (37)**: the capacity marks (37) multiplies (open fractions, edge capacities, supply rates,
  deliverable energy, and the fab and OSAT restoration factors of (13)); an event acts on a target in week t when its
  own mark there, from ``marks.event_capacity_marks`` of the event alone, is below the event-free value; a target-week
  counts when at least one event acts, and combines when two or more do. Cost marks and prohibitions are not (37) and
  are not counted.
- **Capacity-loss share** (V17, which compares it in week 1 against week ceil(T/2)): per week, the value of the
  capacity the week's marks remove over the value of all nominal capacity, harm's (41) valuation read week by week
  (``harm.capacity_loss_share``, re-exported here); 0 without events, 1 when nothing is left.
- **Starvation** (§3.4: "Tanker overrides that starve containers of throughput are reported as telemetry"): in every
  week with an override (an override slot that passed the validity rules, ``StepRecord.override_requested``) or a hold,
  and no D9 fallback, the container-pool units the chokepoint step releases at each chokepoint, against the units it
  releases from the same state with the week's overrides and holds dropped; the starved units are the positive part
  of the difference, summed over those weeks and chokepoints. The replay plays the episode's own D9 fallback
  (``naive_fq.fallback_spec``: naive with the generator's F_Q on a generated omega, the point mass at 0 on an injected
  list), so its fallback weeks replay identically. Naive never overrides (§8.1 step 6), so its telemetry is
  zero; with throughput per pool (9) and one pool per edge (§12 defaults) an override takes no container throughput,
  so the telemetry is zero on every such instance, `tiny` included.
