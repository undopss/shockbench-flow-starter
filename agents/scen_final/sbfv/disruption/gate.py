"""The V12 generator gate, per rung (design §10 V12 and its targets table; Q60, Q88; §11 row 81).

The statistics, each a package function so that the release gate can call them:

(a) **Time rescaling (36).** Every (block, region) stream's onsets, rescaled by the compensator of (30) given the
    episode's regime paths and X (the arrays omega stores), are i.i.d. Exp(1) under the model (Brown et al. 2002;
    Ogata 1988). The streams of all episodes are laid end to end with each stream's censored tail carried into the
    next gap (``hawkes.pooled_residuals``; dropping the tails biases short streams low) and tested by KS against
    Exp(1): pooled, per block, and per stream (Holm within the stream family). The compensator reads the whole cluster
    draw on [-B_burn, T): omega stores neither the burn-in events whose window ended before the instant 0 nor the
    no-op events (no feasible type), yet both excite (30), so the gate takes the generator's full draw of (E_split, n)
    (deterministic by (27)) and, given the omega, checks that the draw's regime paths and X are omega's, bit for bit.
(b) **Marks.** Durations, severities, restoration and rates, per event type, against their laws (``MarkLaws``,
    ``PoissonParams``). A law is split into its atoms and its continuous part by its own components and CDF
    (``Law.components``, ``Law.cdf``; ``split_law``): each atom's share by an exact binomial test (a law that is one
    atom, a constant, exactly), the draws off the atoms by KS against the renormalised continuous CDF (the persistent
    mixture (39), the MID5 one-day atom, the stoppage/slowdown mixture of strikes).
    Tariff rates are the imposing region's tension-state rate at onset exactly (Q32), piracy's rate its severity
    exactly, and a conflict's restoration code the profile's regime exactly. Every draw is tested, burn-in included:
    omega keeps only the events whose window reaches the episode, a length-biased subset (Q40: every draw is kept).
(c) **Fano with regimes frozen.** On constant regime paths the baseline is constant and (35) gives the exact
    covariance of the 104-week window counts; the counts of consecutive windows ending at T, after a warm-up of
    3 t_95 (33), give the Fano factor of every active region and of the total, each tested by TOST +-10 % (alpha 0.05
    per side) with SEs across episodes, Holm across the targets (§10 preamble). The Fano is a variance estimate of
    heavy-tailed counts, so the one-sided p-values are the studentised bootstrap's over episodes (``fano_tost``).
(d) **Conflict layer.** On the generator's regime draws, the weekly onset rate among none-weeks against m_cls
    p-bar_on (TOST +-10 %) and the none / minor / war shares against 0.82 / 0.13 / 0.05 (TOST +-0.01 absolute),
    Holm (``conflict_layer_gate``).
(e) **Tension layer.** On the generator's regime draws, the declared uptime u_p and mean spell T-bar_p of (28), read
    from the chain's own steps: the mean spell as tension weeks per exit (TOST +-10 %), the uptime as the normal share
    h / (h + p_0) of the two-state chain with the estimated exit and none-state entry probabilities (TOST +-10 % of the
    tension share 1 - u_p), Holm (``tension_layer_gate``).
(f) **Militarised closures per year at the anchor rung.** V22's record estimator (``realism``: every militarised
    closure of the whole generated process after its Hawkes transient, per year, SE across episodes) against the
    calibration target of §2.4, TOST +-10 % (``closure_rate_gate``). The calibration itself is analytic, by the
    product of means of (32) under pi^c; only generated episodes, regimes on, test the emergent rate.

Reported, not gated: the unconditional 104-week Fano with regimes on against a high-replication run of the cluster
sampler (``unconditional_fano``).

Pass rules (V12): every KS and binomial test p > 0.001 at a fixed seed, the stream and mark families after Holm (the
pooled and per-block tests unadjusted); every TOST target rejects non-equivalence after Holm.

Power (§11 row 81): ``rate_matched`` builds the hardest gamma alternative, a generator whose rung is off by a given
amount but whose stationary event rate (32) is the declared one (the alternative of ``f5_fano.py`` part D), so the KS
must see the clustering, not the rate. The sizing study itself (episodes for a target power, detections on disjoint
groups of episodes) is the evidence script ``scripts/python/evidence/v12_power.py``, which calls this module.
