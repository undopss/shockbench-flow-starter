"""`mpc_det`: rolling (51) on the persistence point forecast, horizon from the instance (M4, stream "lp-baselines").

Design §8.2 table, "Gate baselines" and "MPC horizon"; Q17, Q67, Q84, Q95.

Week t: update the observed-graph memory; H_t = min(H, T - t + 1) with H from the sweep label and L of the instance
(``lp_common.lead_time_L``); the window arrays are ``lp_common.persistence_arrays``; the model is
``lp_common.rolled_lp`` (``oracle.lp.build_lp`` on the rolled instance: one row table, V3); solve it through the
status ladder, warm from last week's basis (cold at reset); the action is ``lp_common.week1_action`` of the solution.
Its terminal value V_H is the builder's credit (23) at the window end, so at H_t = T - t + 1 it is end-aware by
construction (no Q98 cut). Every rung failing plays naive's action from the same observation, counted.

The window carries the planning rules (``oracle.lp.build_lp(..., planning_rules=True)``: segment loading pro rata, base
load first, lot and OSAT starts, container releases; design §12 M5 row "Planning rules", owner queue M5-O19 (b)) unless
``MpcDetParams.planning_rules`` is False, M4's window, a policy name of its own.

Each H of the sweep is its own policy name (the name enters ``Trajectory.sha256``, ``Env.reset(policy_name=)`` and the
conformance records): ``mpc_det`` for the canonical H = L (the §2.6 separation pair; design §12 M4 row "Horizon"),
``mpc_det[H=<label>]`` for the others.
