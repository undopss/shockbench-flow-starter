"""The clip of the policy's requests, (3)-(5), and the fleet slack (7) (design §3.3; Q2, Q42, Q49, Q68 E3).

Requests are indexed by action slot (edge, commodity, lane). (3) masks slots whose commodity the edge does not permit or
whose pair is in Z_t; (4) caps each edge's total over its requests at the residual capacity u'_e; (5) scales every
(edge, commodity) total drawing on one stock (tail node, commodity) to that stock, and applies the per-(edge, commodity)
factors pro rata to every lane sub-request. Requests are processed in slot order, so the result is independent of the
order in which the policy listed them (F1 evidence ``f1_clip_order.py``). Each factor is at most 1.

Floating-point order follows the design's reference code (``scripts/python/evidence/tiny_fixture.py``, ``Sim.step``
step 4): sequential sums starting from 0.0, the edge factor ``min(1, u / total)``, the stock factor
``min(1, A / total)`` and the executed quantity ``(q * f_edge) * f_stock``; the fleet factor is applied as
``q * cap / total`` when the pool binds (7). When a sum of requests overflows the float range (requests near the float
maximum, which no reference run makes), (4)-(5) are computed in exact rational arithmetic and each executed quantity is
rounded once (``_exact_clip``); so is (7) for a pool whose total overflows or whose binding product ``q * cap`` leaves
the normal float range (``fleet_slack``; M1 pre-gate 3, DOC-1).

Edge clamp (Q95): with a request near the float maximum on an edge of small capacity, the edge factor of (4) is
subnormal and errs by up to 2^-1075 absolutely, so ``q * f_edge`` can put the edge's executed total above u'_e by far
more than 1e-12 relative (docs/004 §3.1: 1.1955e307 on E11 at 1200 x 2^-52 executed 2.664535259103041e-13 against
2.6645352591003757e-13). On an edge whose factor (4) is subnormal, ``clip_requests`` therefore takes the executed
quantities from u'_e in slot order under the stock clamp rule of ``sim._take`` (Q58 M11, design §12 'Stock clamps and
dust lots'): a residual left in [-b, 0), with b = 1e-12 max(u'_e, |x|, q, smallest normal float) and q the slot's
request (the draw from which its share of (4) was computed), sets that slot to the residual before it and is logged as
(slot, value); anything lower raises ``RuntimeError`` (``edge_clamp``). A normal factor errs by a few units in the last
place, as it always did (inside the tolerance of the replay (53)), and is left alone, so no run with a normal factor
moves; nor does the exact path, which rounds each quantity once. The override step at chokepoints
(``chokepoint._overrides``) computes its (4)-(5) with ``edge_stock_clip`` too and passes a log, so its override slots
pass the same clamp on an out-edge whose factor (4) is subnormal (a probe released 1.28e-3 relative above u'_e there
before), logged by override slot in ``StepRecord.override_clamps``.

The fleet slack (7) sums ``Delta tau * x`` over the terms of ``Instance.dup_items`` (edge, lane or None, Delta tau): a
term with lane None, an edge-level sea duplicate or the turn-back where a duplicate lane leaves its route at a
chokepoint, matches every flow on its edge; a term with a lane, a sea duplicate lane leaving its route at its entry
edge, matches only the flow that edge carries on that lane (design §3.3: "Cape, Lombok-Sunda and east-of-Taiwan lanes
and turn-back edges into them"). Every matching release, dispatch or chokepoint release, is scaled when its pool binds.

Residual edge capacity (general rule): u'_e = u^t_e minus the chokepoint releases on e this week. Action slots never
leave a chokepoint (§12, action slots), so on every instance u'_e = u^t_e for every edge that carries a request; the
reference computes its chokepoint residuals separately for the same reason.
