"""The naive anchor, the numbered rule of design §8.1 (Q8, Q54, Q84, Q98): RSS = 0 and the D9 fallback.

A function of the current prediction-free observation and the instance only; no state across weeks (the plan is a
function of the instance). Reset: the plan from the reset-time min-cost flow (22) (``instance.nominal``), route demand
by node type (step 2), order-up-to levels S_jk = sum of S^nv_lk (67) plus I-bar_g at grids, offset 0 except into a
terminal (step 3), and the last useful weeks (71)-(72) of the end-aware cut. Week t:
inventory position (step 4), order-up-to (5), route choice with the 2x give-up rule on routes observed closed (6), and
no flow on a slot past its last useful week (the end-aware cut, Q98; below); the requests then pass the clip like any
policy's (7). On an injected event list without a generator F_Q is the point mass at 0, so the closure term of (67)
vanishes (§8.1). ``NaivePolicy(end_aware=False)`` (named ``naive_plain``) is the horizon-blind naive without the cut,
kept for tests and evidence ("plain naive"); it is neither the anchor nor the fallback.

Readings where §8.1 leaves a choice (the conservative one, fixed here):

- **Route demand** (step 2), d_lk per week: into a sink upsilon F_lk m^sea(t) (F_lk the route's nominal flow, its share
  of F-bar_ik times F-bar_ik); into a fab upsilon cap^0_f times the route's share of the fab's wafer inflow; into a grid
  zeta_gk G-bar^0_g times the route's share of the fuel inflow; into an OSAT upsilon F_lk; into a terminal F_lk (the
  route's nominal flow, no utilisation; tested on a terminal variant of `tiny`, which has none). A route into any other
  node type has no rule and raises. ``NaiveRoute.d`` holds the value at m^sea = 1; the seasonal factor of week t is
  m^sea[(t - 1) mod 52] (episode week 1 = week 1 of the profile) and applies to both terms of (67) and to the cap in
  the week-t target. The order split uses the same d_lk, which is proportional to the nominal flow within one
  destination (Q84's "in proportion to nominal flow"), m^sea cancelling there.
- **Duplicate**: the first edge (instance order), else the first lane, whose ``alt_of`` names the route (``{"lane": l}``
  for a lane route, ``{"edge": e}`` for an edge route), permits k and has an action slot; its first edge, lane and
  base freight (sum of c^0) are kept.
- **Offset** (step 3, red-team CMP2-1): step 3 derives offset 0 from the step order (arrivals at step 6 precede
  consumption at steps 7-8). A terminal consumes by dispatching to its grid at step 5, which draws on I^{t-1} before
  the week's arrivals, so by the same derivation an order on a route into a terminal serves the dispatch of week
  t + tau_l + 1: o_l = 1 there, S*_lk = (tau_l + 2) d_lk + closure term, and the cover cap shifts by the same week;
  o_l = 0 into every other node type (fabs, OSATs, grids and sinks consume their inflow at steps 7-8). The terminal's
  end-of-week stock then settles at S_jk - sum_l (tau_l + 1) b (b its weekly dispatch), leaving S_jk - sum_l
  (tau_l + 2) b >= 0 after the next week's dispatch.
- **Cover cap** (§8.1, §11 row 37): w_max = max(tau_l, tau_alt) + 1 + o_l with alt the duplicate, else the fastest
  other route into j for k open at reset (an action-slot edge or lane into j permitting k, no (edge, k) prohibited at
  reset, u^0 > 0); uncapped (None) with neither.
- **Closure term** of (67): the quantile F^{-1}_{Q_cb}(pi/(pi + h)) of a route into (j, k) through chokepoint c in
  pool b is ``fq_quantile[(c, pool, j, k)]`` (the critical ratio is the destination's, §2.4 profile row;
  ``naive_fq.critical_quantiles`` builds these from the laws of ``naive_fq.fq_laws``), else 0; pool names are "tb",
  "ct", and a key that names no lane route of the plan raises. A route into a fab or an OSAT carries no term (1^cl =
  0 of (67), ``carries_closure_term``; owner queue M5-O33 (b)): lot starts (12) and packaging (19) take that stock
  each week, so it is never held; its quantile stays in the map (published per lane) and is not read. d_cb of (66)
  sums d_lk over the plan's lanes through c in pool b (``lane_demand``), the plants' lanes included (their cargo
  queues at c). A lane through several chokepoints adds one term per chokepoint
  (provisional: §8.1 prescribes a reset-time simulation of naive's routed network for tandem lanes; `tiny` has one
  chokepoint). ``fq_quantile=None`` gives 0 (the point mass at 0 of injected lists). On a generated omega the
  quantiles are the generator's, ``naive_fq.generator_quantiles(inst, params)`` (cached per instance content digest,
  ``generator_id`` and replication count, never per hash label alone; DET-M2-3), for the anchor of (55)
  (``naive_fq.anchor_policy``) and the D9 fallback alike (``NaiveFallback``, the ``Env`` fallback spec, which carries
  the generator id and the instance content digest). The quantiles are converted to floats before the plan and its
  cache key see them (``canonical_quantiles``; DET-P3-4): a finite real number >= 0 (F^{-1} of a queue length), a
  ``Decimal`` included; any other value raises.
- **Grid buffer** (step 3): I-bar_gk of (16) is added to S_jk when j is grid g and k one of its buffered fuels (the
  grid's ``ibar`` entries: the gas rationing buffer, and on `small` and `full` the nuclear fuel cover, design §3.5);
  other fuels get none. On `tiny` the only buffered fuel is the rationed gas.
- **Observation** (step 4, 6): IP_jk sums on-hand stock, pipeline shipments of k whose route ends at j (the lane's
  destination when the shipment carries a lane, else the edge head), queued lots of k whose lane ends at j, minus
  backlog. A route is observed closed if a chokepoint on it shows ``graph_now.open`` <= the threshold, or an edge on it
  shows u <= 0 or is prohibited for k; a null (unobserved) value never closes a route. A request on a slot whose own
  (edge, k) ``graph_now.prohibited`` lists is not sent: it would be dropped as invalid (§9.3), which equals a zero
  request, so omitting it changes no dynamics and keeps naive's invalid count at 0. That is the dispatch rule, not
  ``slot_mask``, which since Q111 also masks a lane slot for a later edge of its lane (a request the environment would
  carry out); ``slot_mask`` equalled the rule before Q111 and is null exactly when ``graph_now`` is, so naive, the
  anchor and the D9 fallback play as before. Other requests are sent even at qty 0.
- **Immutability** (DET-3): the plan is deeply immutable (tuples and ``FrozenDict``, coerced on construction, so a write
  raises TypeError), and the per-instance cache keeps the instance and plan pickled: every reset unpickles a private
  copy, so no policy (a subclass included, even one bypassing FrozenDict) can change J^naive or the D9 fallback of a
  later episode.
- **Provenance** (DC-3, DET-2): every reset hashes the Static's instance JSON as received, keys the cache by that hash
  and raises when it is not the declared ``instance_hash``, so the same Static raises or not whatever ran before.

**End-aware cut** (Q98, design (71)-(72); the rule "R7" as measured on branch ``q96-r7``, b0cc92f). Naive starts no
work whose goods cannot reach a point of use by T, judged from T and Static's nominal lead times only (no forecast, no
observed event): its action is naive's (steps 4-6 unchanged) with every flow on an action slot past that slot's last
useful week removed (``last_useful_weeks``, ``end_aware_action``). The plan (22), F_Q (66)-(67) and the load (69) do
not read it. The rule, with tau_e the nominal lead of edge e in Static, tau_l the sum over a route's edges, R+(i, k)
naive's planned routes (step 1) out of node i carrying k and head(l) a route's destination (a lane's last head):

- *Last useful arrival week* A_jk (71), the last week in which a unit of k arriving at node j can still reach a point
  of use by T through naive's planned routes (arrivals join stock at step 6 of §3.2):
  - A_jk = T at a point of use: a sink with demand for k (served at step 8 of its arrival week) and a grid burning k
    (burned at step 7);
  - A_fw = max_{l in R+(f, r)} (A_{head(l) r} - tau_l) - 1 - tau^fab_f at a fab f with input w and product r: a lot
    starts in its arrival week (step 7), its raw chips join the fab's stock at step 7 of week start + tau^fab and leave
    one week later at the earliest, since a dispatch draws on last week's stock (5);
  - A_or = max_{l in R+(o, p)} (A_{head(l) p} - tau_l) - 1 - tau^osat_o at an OSAT o packaging raw r into p: packaging
    starts in the arrival week (step 7), its output joins stock at week start + tau^osat and leaves a week later;
  - A_ik = max_{l in R+(i, k)} (A_{head(l) k} - tau_l) - 1 at any other node with a planned route out (a terminal,
    and a supply node: on `tiny` naive's routes leave src_gulf on E0 and mat_jp on E9, E11 and E13, so A is 22 for LNG
    at src_gulf and 9 for wafers at mat_jp; no action slot and no planned route ends at a supply node, so no W reads
    it);
  - none (no week is useful) at a node with no planned route out that is not a point of use (a chokepoint, which a
    lane passes through, or a node naive's plan does not feed).
- *Last useful week* (72) of an action slot s = (e, k, lane) bound for j (the lane's destination, else the edge head):
  W_s = A_jk - tau_s, tau_s the slot's nominal transit. A lane through chokepoints counts its edges' leads only: a
  chokepoint passes cargo on in its arrival week (§3.4), and the rule reads neither the queue nor the open fraction, so
  a queue wait is never assumed; the chokepoint itself is no point of use (a lane's cargo is bound for its
  destination). An ``alt_of`` duplicate naive switches to (step 6) is judged by its own transit: the Cape duplicate E3
  of L1 on `tiny` has W = T - 6, where L1 has T - 4. Slots naive never sends get a W too, from their destination.
- *Last useful start week* of a plant: A_fw at fab f (its wafers), A_or at OSAT o (each raw chip it packages).
- *The target* of week t (Q109, amending Q98's "bit for bit"): S^end_jk(t) = S_jk(t) less the cut's phantom pipeline,
  sum over naive's routes l into (j, k) of sum_{u = max(W_l + 1, t - tau_l, 1)}^{t - 1} d_lk m^sea(u)
  (``phantom_pipeline``, ``end_aware_targets``; W_l of the route's own slot): the dispatches the cut withheld would be
  in the pipeline, and without the correction their absence reads as a deficit that step 5 re-splits onto the
  destination's faster routes (the week-103 loss of `full`, 2,726 chips at the anchor before Q109). A naive-derived
  baseline's own targets pass through the same correction (``end_aware_action(..., targets=)``).
- *The action* of week t: naive's steps 4-6 on S^end, on every slot s with t <= W_s, and no entry on any other slot.
  Nothing else changes: no re-split of a dropped share (the next week's inventory position is lower, and naive orders
  again on its routes), no override and no hold (naive sends none, §8.1 step 6; the default release at a chokepoint is
  the environment's rule, §3.4, not naive's dispatch, so queue lots already at c are stock on hand), and stock on hand
  is untouched: a fab still starts, and an OSAT still packages, the wafers and raw chips on hand after A (a simulator
  rule, §3.5), which only a dispatch naive does not send can prevent.
- *Fab conversion* (wafer to raw chip): judged at nominal, with tau^fab and no capacity, scrap, restoration or energy
  limit, so a lot that waits for capacity starts later than A_fw assumes; the rule never reads those.

On `tiny` at T = 26: A = 26 at `sink_us` and both grids, 19 at `osat_sea` (raw), 9 / 11 / 6 at `fab_tw` / `fab_cn` /
`fab_us` (wafers); W = 23 on L0, 22 on L1, 20 on E3, 8 / 10 / 3 on E9 / E11 / E13, 18 / 18 / 15 on E17 / E19 / E20 and
22 on L3 (``tests/test_naive_end_aware.py``). The D9 fallback is the same rule: the ``Env`` spec ``"naive"`` (injected
lists) or a ``NaiveFallback`` (``naive_fq.naive_fallback``), both end-aware by default; ``"naive_plain"`` and
``NaiveFallback(..., end_aware=False)`` play plain naive (tests and evidence only).
