"""The reset-time information view of one episode: every feed of theta, built once (design §5.1, §5.4; (1)).

``build_view(inst, omega, theta, *, marks)`` is the one builder: pure in (instance, omega, theta), it never reads the
State and holds no simulator (§5.4 "Rules"), so the wrapper outside the environment core (``observe.wrap``) degrades
the core observation from these tables alone, at reset, every step, the D9 fallback and restore alike. One omega serves
every theta: nothing is drawn or re-sampled per regime (R1 A4; pairing R5.11). The view is immutable and shared, like
the instance and the marks, by ``Env``'s episode copies and snapshots, so ``restore`` rebuilds nothing from omega
(``Static`` included: ``dyads`` and ``theta`` travel here). The week tables of ``pending_prohibitions`` and
``closure_end`` are built here once, for every week 1..T (never per step).

Readings of design §12 (M3 rows):

- Resets without what a regime needs: a marks-only reset (no omega, the M1 fixture path) accepts prediction_free only,
  with ``demand_forecast`` null, since (48) needs omega's ``eps_parts``. A generated omega without
  ``meta_information_params`` (every M2 omega: ``sample_omega`` with ``GeneratorParams.information`` None) keeps the
  M2 observation under prediction_free and the coverage rungs, ``demand_forecast`` null, so no M2 pin moves; any
  regime with a warning or messages raises on it. An injected omega needs no meta (no conflict layer, so
  (48) has no Xi term, and no shadows): prediction_free shows (48) on it, and a regime with a warning or messages
  raises on it (no latent paths). A blackout rung raises on an omega without a spell of its kind.
- Blackout: the spell of theta's kind is omega's ``blk_start[k] <= t < blk_end[k]``, k its ``codes.BLACKOUT_SPELLS``
  code (a to_end spell has ``blk_end`` = T + 1); in those weeks the own state and ``last_week`` are kept and every
  external feed is null (``graph_now``, its ``fab`` and ``osat`` included, ``slot_mask`` and the five feeds).
- closure_end (theta.chi): one entry per closure event (militarised or weather) acting on a chokepoint at the instant
  t - 1 (t_on <= t - 1 < t_on + T_q), ``end_week`` = w(t_on + T_q), which may exceed T; never null in a named regime.
  Several closures may act on one chokepoint at once, so the list is per event, never per chokepoint.
- pending_prohibitions: clairvoyant's is exact (``clairvoyant_pending``: every future prohibition of omega's ``ev_*``
  events, announced or not); every other regime with the feed reads the shown publications (``messages.pending_at``).
- Clairvoyant: ``omega_public`` is ``wire.public_omega(omega)``, omega without ``meta_episode`` and ``meta_split``
  (trusted side only), an immutable ``Omega`` of its read-only arrays; ``Env`` hands out ``wire.omega_payload`` of it,
  built afresh at each reset and restore, as ``info['omega']`` and ``Reset.omega`` in local and dev runs only, to a
  policy that declares ``wants_omega`` (``policies.base``).
- messages: the cumulative feed of week t is a prefix of the shown messages (sorted by instant, ``assign_threads``, and
  w(a) is monotone in the instant a), so the view keeps their §9.2 columns (``messages.messages_at`` at T) and the
  length of each week's prefix; ``observe.wrap`` slices them.
